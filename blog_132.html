    <h1>Developing warmth</h1>

    <p>You may think that telling people they can improve by taking responsibility for their lives and that every flaw
        can be turned into a strength is kind. I must admit, this is a very shallow view of warmth. I can tell that
        after trying to develop warmth for months on end as part of my improvement.
    </p>

    <p>Let me explain. It's this very subtle realization, and you must find it yourself. For example, when a skyscraper
        gets built, everything works together, from the design, planning, recourses, transport, financing, and
        construction. I'm amazed at how civilization is kept together. Aren't you amazed too? It gets even more
        breathtaking when one realizes that no one is truly steering the ship of the world. No one knows what will
        happen tomorrow except for God. Anything could happen tomorrow, and if something brought us forward through
        every adversary, it's kindness.
    </p>

    <p>If one gets lost at the high sea between the waves, and someone notices, almost half an army gets mobilized to
        save someone who doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Even if redemption feels far away and the
        problem overwhelming, if someone is lost in a sea of danger and someone else becomes aware of it, help will
        come—no matter how difficult it is or who is to blame. Call it <a href="blog_52.html">duty</a>, call it compassion, or call it love. God
        didn't abandon the earth either, just because humans a flawed. If there is one thing that brought humans through
        every adversary that ever existed and will ever exist, it is kindness.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Not so fast.</strong></em> Realizing that everything is held together by love took me months. Warmth
        is also not as straightforward as you might think: There are two herculean forces: the heart and the mind.</p>

    <p>Let me show you how the mind and heart fought.</p>

    <h1>Stage 1. Everyone is responsible for their life.</h1>

    <p><em><strong>I have zero empathy.</strong></em> Call me whatever you want. Why should I care about a stranger's
        self-inflicted suffering? Why should you care? Everyone has problems, and everyone is responsible for his own
        life. Why should you pity anyone? The way forward in life is to take full responsibility for it; if someone is
        too weak to do so, they must be left behind. Even if destiny strikes with something outside of your sphere of
        influence, the choice of how to respond is yours. If it starts to rain, you could have brought an umbrella. You
        are responsible for everything that happens, regardless of whether it was your fault. </p>

    <h1>Stage 2. Pity only to those who need it, not those who act weak.</h1>

    <p><em><strong>Petty complains.</strong></em> Even if one's complaints were a hundred percent objective, their
        impact is zero. You can forget about sympathy. The world is built on doing, not on complaining. I can't think of
        a single situation where one benefits from listening to a negativity dump.</p>

    <p><em><strong>You deserve no pity; save it for those who need it.</strong></em> You can pity someone who lost his
        legs, and it doesn't matter whose fault it was. However, those who are young, safe, and healthy deserve no one's
        pity. From a cultural-philosophical perspective, boys become men the second they take full responsibility for
        their lives. If everything is your fault, then where is the sympathy? I couldn't care less about anyone's
        struggle if it's self-inflicted, and my indifference turns into disgust if the person struggling is a spoiled
        brat. I doubt you disagree; do you sincerely care if a random spoiled girl says that her lipstick has the wrong
        tone of red? Showing sympathy for someone who has never struggled is evil. It seems the only reason one would do
        that is to gain attention, validation, or relief from their negativity.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Most people I know people have never struggled.</strong></em> I wrote in one of my texts that every
        man has a similar life. Firstly, they are born, grow a bit up, are bad in every area of life, then fall in love
        with a random girl who rejects them, their heart gets broken, and they stop being a loser. As it turns out, many
        people haven't ever experienced a genuinely broken heart. A broken heart made me suffer for approximately a
        year, so I know what I'm talking about. Yet, that's nothing compared to what billions of people went through or
        are going through. One billion people live on less than a dollar a day. There are thousands of people or even
        children who had their entire families killed by a bomb, and they still have to get up every day and make ends
        meet. Every time I think of my problems, I remember that I have none. Heartbreak? Remember the kid who lost his
        parents in war and is now completely alone and still gets up every day? Your problems, my problems, your
        friends' problems, … they are completely pathetic.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Warmth is, it seems, often an excuse.</strong></em> If you want to win, you need to be hard on
        yourself. Period. Sympathy is for peasants. It’s a scam that warmth will drive you to success, only the
        depravity thereof. Let me tell you a story. There was a nineteen-year-old classmate I used to be friends with.
        He is the antidote to me when it comes to sympathy. He is understanding, tolerant, and compassionate. On the
        question of whether life is better as an owner or a peasant, he responded with the latter. Anyway, with all of
        his compassion, sympathy, and empathy, what do you think happened when he wanted to free himself from his
        digital addiction? His compassion turned into tolerance, weakness, and excuses.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Chances are, I've been there myself and fixed it.</strong></em> If someone struggles with something
        and I've been through it, my compassion doesn't increase; it decreases. Struggling with social media addiction?
        Well, I've been there and broke free. I shared my experience; I knew exactly how such a person thinks and why it
        is difficult. Still, I overcame every obstacle, and those who fail don't try hard enough. It's as simple as
        that. I went from an 8-hour screen time, nothing to do, childhood trauma, no friends, and no support from anyone
        to a 15-minute screen time. Why isn’t everyone able to do it?
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>I specifically avoid getting pity.</strong></em> For years, people sensed something was wrong with
        me, which stemmed from my mental scars. Instead of talking about my traumas, I moved on and wrote about my
        healing process months later. Even my close grandmother didn’t know about my struggles until then. I believe
        that constantly opening up about wounds prevents them from healing—like trying to do pushups with a broken arm.
        Despite knowing that digging into wounds is wrong, I opened up to my friends about matters of my heart. Can you
        guess the cost of those sweet, encouraging words? Moving on was now ten times harder because I gained
        encouragement.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Be willing to pay the price.</strong></em> When I burned out after working for two and a
        half years straight, I didn't complain; I didn't want anyone's pity. I knew it was my fault. If I tried to avoid
        it, I should have never started pursuing business. I paid the price, ten days of nothing and a few handicapped
        weeks. When someone who does nothing else than sports damages his knees, he pays the price for his sports. But
        if this person complains, trying to get some pity, he is detached from reality. Always, you need to be willing
        to pay the price. If you don't agree to pay the price, don't do it. If you didn't expect to pay a price, learn.
        If you agreed to pay the price, paid it, and started to suffer, only then may you deserve sympathy.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Warmth is no virtue if you don't have control.</strong></em> Of course, war is evil, and everyone is
        anti-war, yet nothing changes if you complain about it. No matter how much you can relate to the civilians'
        misery, nothing changes; you may as well not care. In this context, empathy, in that sense, is mere virtue
        signaling. The first lesson of stoicism is not to think of things you can't change anyway. Only if you are
        willing to do something and know that what you do has an impact, may you feel pity, but then you must do
        something.
    </p>

    <h1>Stage 3. I believe a flaw is not something to pity, and everything can be turned into a strength.</h1>

    <p>My life consists of pretty much failures only. I write, no one reads, I speak, no one listens, I create, and no
        one uses. Failed apps, flopping videos, and insignificant texts are all that there is. Next to objectively
        failing at almost everything I attempt, I have many flaws. But that's ok, because I try hard to compensate.
    </p>

    <p>A large ego is objectively a flaw. Arrogant people are usually irrelevant, especially if they age. If they don't
        get humble, no one wants to spend time with them, and their ego daggers them from within. Furthermore, many
        egocentric people think that they can stop learning or even stop putting in the work because they are special,
        entitled, or 'misunderstood'. Consequently, their ego makes them unpleasant to be around and they fail at
        everything since they are too smart to try. Due to the nature of ego, many realize only too late the wrong path
        they were on. Hence, ego brings many problems for most and it's better to remove that flaw. - Yet, I have a very
        large ego, and somehow, I don't rot from within. How so? Well, it did cause a lot of pain to figure out how to
        use it. Now I understand, that I need to earn thinking highly of myself - that's called humility. I know, that
        if I want to feel like the alpha, which I want because of my ego, I need to do what it takes. Doing what it
        takes means accepting that one is a nobody and needs to put in the effort. In that sense, humility is the
        process of justifying ego. And that's true. The more my ego grows, the humbler and loving I get. The moments I
        move forward the most are when I'm the kindest. The only reason I'm developing myself is because of my ego. If I
        were a peasant, all loving, humble, and balanced, I wouldn't need to write a text where I transform myself.
        Neither would I need to get up in the middle of the night and neither would I need to go to the gym. Anything
        that doesn't have an ego is dead, the leaf blown by the wind, a snowflake falling in silence, or a river finding
        its way without resistance. Anything that strives does it because of ego, even if said ego is abstract. We went
        from ego making one unpleasant to be around to the only reason one should grow.
    </p>

    <p>I believe that everyone can take their flaws or handicaps and turn them into greatness.
    </p>

    <p>That’s the magic of compensation.
    </p>

    <h1>Stage 4. Regardless of the rationale, one needs to be a human.</h1>

    <p>But then, I felt something.
    </p>

    <p>I wanted to tell you a story, but I struggle to because that's more of an intuition. I saw how everyone has their
        place in the universe.
    </p>

    <p>If someone grew up with lazy parents, was fed doughnuts, and was told he needed to rest otherwise, he would work
        himself to death. If he gets a gaming console for Christmas and has no discipline at all, he is set to become a
        loser. It would take herculean strength to overcome these obstacles. Here’s another example. Because school is
        boring, some children don’t want to sit down. Some teachers take them as a bad example, which reinforces their
        image. That then creates a negative ripple effect.
    </p>

    <p>Everyone has their place in the universe; by a hair, that position can change.
    </p>

    <p>I thought further. Usually, I don’t care about strangers. I keep my emotions in my inner circle. But then, I
        remembered something. However, there's a guy I have known since early childhood, and he has zero self-esteem, a
        complete curvy-back mentality. I haven't spoken to him in years, yet sometimes I see him. It appears he
        stagnates in life. He doesn’t have a hot blonde. I know that he didn't have it easy, and I think to myself: may
        God bless him. But still, the responsibility is his. I indeed feel nothing for the person that I don't know who
        wastes his life and shows weakness, more so if I've been through it myself, but man, … I understand that
        sometimes bad things happen not because - but just.
    </p>

    <h1>Stage 5. Love is at the center</h1>

    <p>Normally I have an easy time ignoring things. As you may know, I create videos on self-improvement. Naturally,
        there are useless and mean comments. For some reason, it started to bother me. After it stayed in my mind for a
        while, it still bothered me.
    </p>

    <p>I realized that that’s because I lacked love. Would I really if I had my hot blondes, a monument, and a sweet
        village house? I realized that love is indeed in the center. Power means letting things go your way. It can also
        mean - tiger. But power can also mean not caring about things. Thus, I learned that love is power.
    </p>

    <p>Why try hard? For love, for nothing more, nothing less.
    </p>

    <p><em>“I will do everything in my power to get what matters. I will dedicate every second of my life aligned with my
        purpose; I will go to monumental lengths for love.”</em> – text #87
