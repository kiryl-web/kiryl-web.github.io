    <h1>A walk</h1>

    <p> I'm lucky, and it's all a test
    </p>

    <p> It was twilight; darkness was taking over, and I was vulnerable—alone and unprepared to navigate the turbulent
        waters of life. I entered a part of my walk surrounded by a dark, timid, foggy forest. I had seen deer and foxes
        here in the previous months, but I also knew that other wild animals could threaten me. Of course, it was this
        second when it made a sound in the scrub.
    </p>

    <p> I didn't care too much; a little bird wouldn't threaten me. But then, I was taking a turn, and I saw a sudden
        white flash thirty meters to the left. It was barely in my field of view. I identified the flash to be two
        meters tall and half a meter wide. Consciousness struck me again; I woke up. I could not make sense of what I
        saw. After hesitating for precisely one breath, I tilted my head with striking precision, ready to confront
        reality.
    </p>

    <p> It was quiet. As it turned out, it was only a partly collapsed birch tree. I decided to never wander alone in
        the twilight again. After walking for a while longer, I saw someone in the woods I truly doubted my perception.
        That puzzled me.
    </p>

    <p> That’s how I realized that life is a test.
    </p>

    <p> Everything I saw was testing me; every obstacle, thought, and experience – it’s all a test.
    </p>

    <p> Yes, life is unfair. I could have lost the birth lottery. Instead, I was blessed with life experience, material
        wealth, health, and a sharp mind for effectively free. But the most profound realization came here: if every
        moment constitutes a test, doesn't that mean trying your best is the only solution to life's unfairness?
    </p>

    <p> It’s your <a href="blog_52.html">duty</a> to strive for uncompromising excellence. You must use your situation
        to make the best out of it.
        The <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a> of life is to give your gifts away.
    </p>

    <p> Every moment is a test. No moment should be wasted; everything happening is a test you must pass. </p>
