    <h1>How I met my girl</h1>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1. What this text is about</strong></p>

    <p>I haven’t found my hot blonde or cute brunette, but I want to test my life philosophy.
    </p>

    <p>I want to lay out my predictions and hold myself accountable.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1.1. What if I'm wrong?</strong></p>

    <p>I am often mistaken; therefore, I won't lose much if I'm wrong again. Until you achieve success so colossal that
        it overshadows every setback, failures remain invisible anyway.
    </p>

    <p>Besides, will I truly care about being mistaken if the upside could be the love of my life?
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1.2. What if I'm right?</strong></p>

    <p>I’m in a position where I have little to lose and abundant to gain. If I'm right, I will have - once more -
        gathered irrefutable evidence to cement my philosophy's superiority and my domination across all realms. I will
        see this sign as permission to be great.
    </p>

    <p>I make no compromise: This text is of near-cosmic significance. After all, everyone repeats, “You must wait for
        love, and everything shall fall into place. Love comes the moment you’d least expect. Be patient; you never
        know!” Yet, I think this is a fallacious way to navigate life. If I'm right and prove the first tenet of love
        false, then what?
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. My approach to life</strong></p>

    <p>I’m a true philosopher. I believe those who show up every day, do the brave thing, and genuinely give their best
        cannot fail in the long run, for life is incredibly giving.
    </p>

    <p>I believe that God is always watching and has favorites: those who show the beauty of God’s creation will get
        monumentally rewarded for doing so.
    </p>

    <p>I believe in attaining an indomitable spirit and piercing through life with speed and courage.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. I will find her at a train station</strong></p>

    <p>As a true philosopher, I'm capable of strategic thinking.
    </p>

    <p>Before my fifty rejections project, I concluded that a big city’s central train station is the ideal location to
        find love. Because I wasn’t looking for love, I executed my fifty rejections project in a business setting by
        asking small businesses whether they wanted to buy my photos. Furthermore, my village didn’t have a suitable
        train station, and back then, I hadn’t overcome the girl I had asked out four times, so I didn’t want to confuse
        my heart. But now I have overcome her, and I am in a big city.
    </p>

    <p>Train stations are ideal for finding love because women of all levels—and obviously all hair colors—are abundant.
        Also, I'm at the train station every day. Asking out someone who unmistakably holds eye contact is easy because
        train stations are very hectic. Even if I were to mess up badly, no one would care.
    </p>

    <p>Furthermore, train stations usually have florists.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Why I don’t read</strong></p>

    <p>I believe in closing chapters and making peace with one’s past. Because I shut down my second business, I moved
        its files to a hard drive to protect my peace of mind. Looking at my other files, I saw a snapshot from my blog.
    </p>

    <p>It read, “What’s your favorite bouquet color?”
    </p>

    <p>I shall use that sentence as a declaration of interest. She probably won’t know which color she wants, because
        women are notoriously indecisive and shy. So, I will tell her to wait for a surprise or ask her to come with me.
        I will give her my number; after all, that’s what I printed business cards for. Right below the tracks of my
        train line, there’s a florist.
    </p>

    <p>I’ve prepared long ago—four years of self-improvement. I’ve been rejected seventy-five times before. I know
        exactly what to say and how to say it.
    </p>

    <p>I have nothing holding me back.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Isn’t life beautiful</strong></p>

    <p>I have zero desire for her phone number; all I want is a monumental story. I will never fall for the trap of
        ‘later’ ever again. We will have our first date right away, on a walk in the city – or on the train itself,
        mirroring an adventurous life in motion.
    </p>

    <p>I don't know how things will go from here. She will either test my integrity or be a gift from God.
    </p>

    <p>I’m an optimist for every attempt,<br>
        yet I count on failure nonetheless.
    </p>

    <p>Because my business cards contain my blog, I wonder how long it will take her to come across this text. Perhaps,
        being the gentleman I am, I could subtly hint it to her.
    </p>

    <p>I look forward to telling her parents how I, “without expecting anything,” found her.
    </p>

    <p>Yet, I have to assume something completely unconceivable is awaiting me. I think God might find a way to twist
        every assumption of mine.
    </p>

    <p>There’s always room for a miracle.
