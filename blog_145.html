    <h1>September 17th, 2024</h1>

    <p>After making peace with my mother, my second business failing, I decided to give online dating another try.
        Yesterday evening, I spent an hour, and I saw a former classmate there. Before I skipped 9th grade, she used to
        be in my grade. We’ve known each other since primary school, but I never paid attention to her.
    </p>

    <p>However, I concluded, she might be the one. So, I wanted to take matters into my own hands this morning.* After
        hesitating for presicely three seconds, I phoned her. I was sitting on a train. She
        declined, then I got left on read, making this 75th** rejection.
    </p>

    <p>I don't read;<br> I don't need wisdom;<br> I need execution, for I believe in speed.
    </p>

    <p>I had called her, because if something is important enough, the only thing that matters is trying. Most things in
        life don’t matter; love isn’t one of them. In a world of infinite complexity, the only thing worthy of judgment
        is the purity of one’s heart.
    </p>

    <p>Getting left on read didn't surprise me too much, because we don't really know each other. Maybe she has forgotten
        about me?
    </p>

    <p>I'm in a position where I cannot lose. I'm an optimist for the
        very fact I tried.</p>

    <p>I cannot give up, I cannot fatigue; for my resilience knows no bounds. Uncompromising excellence is a true
        testament to the indomitability of my spirit.</p>

    <p>*I think, this app shadowbanned me. Why did I get zero likes and zero matches when I have built enough social
        skills to talk to any girl about anything?
    </p>

    <p>**70 rejections from July 2024 had nothing to do with women, instead, business. However, I bloody well knew that
        I wanted to avoid being badly heartbroken again, so I meditated through these rejections in 4 days, in person.
