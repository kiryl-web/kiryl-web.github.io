    <h1>On a day of mine.</h1>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1. Decision one. Letting go of my failed apps.</strong></p>

    <p>Today, I received a letter stating that I must change something about the privacy policy of my apps by December
        7th. It also said I needed my apps to have an ‘account deletion option,’ but my apps don’t have the option to
        create accounts. I find that toxic. So, I decided to delete my apps from the internet. I don’t want to keep
        putting in the work for something that doesn’t bring me money or skill.
    </p>

    <p>For context, three years ago, I started learning how to program; more than a year ago, my mental math apps went
        online, and three months ago, I left them behind because they failed. Yet, by the time my apps failed three
        months ago, I decided to keep them online as a testament to my strength and for a potential future job. But now
        they’re going down because the effort is not worth it. They’ve become a liability, not an asset.
    </p>

    <p>Furthermore, I'm not allowed to say this on camera, but I can say that on my blog. My apps were illegal. I had no
        tax identity, and I was not eighteen years old. So, I better delete my apps before something happens.
    </p>

    <p>Additionally, if I create apps in the future, I can simply create a new account. It’s unlikely I will restart
        creating apps because I would need to <a href="blog_3.html">focus</a> and I would need a lot more recourses.
    </p>

    <p>That means this decision has no downsides.
    </p>

    <p>Hence, it’s obvious what to do.
    </p>

    <p>However, the deletion was not very smooth. I still saw potential in some of my apps. Maybe I should create
        another ad campaign? Maybe I should give them one more try? Maybe, maybe, maybe… No. I decided to meditate
        through this breakup. After three years of commitment, I decided to let go of my apps.
    </p>

    <p>Such is the art of letting go.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Decision two. I’m going to eat meat </strong></p>

    <p>Maybe I am stupid. Since 5 years old, I’ve been fighting not to eat meat. Since 11 years old, my mother gave up
        resisting. So, now that I'm 16 years old, I effectively haven’t eaten meat in a over decade. I would still eat
        meat here and there, but that amount was negligible. I simply didn’t like the taste of meat. Today, I decided to
        admit my ignorance. And I did. Now that I’ve eaten meat, I will continue to do so for the rest of my life. My
        energy and mental clarity improved significantly. I believe this change will serve me in my 50 video – 90-day
        project that started today.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Indecision three. This one girl</strong></p>

    <p>I asked out a girl back in June, got rejected, and still haven’t gotten over her. A lot has changed since then,
        and I'm still fighting a battle between my ideals and my heart. Now, I don’t know what to do.</p>
