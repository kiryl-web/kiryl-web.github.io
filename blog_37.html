        content="A long time ago, I created my Google Play developer page's slogan to “Improve mental math”. But today this changed, since I changed it to “Uplifting products” as this slogan is more universal and represents a brand shift overall, that I decided to make, because “Uplifting products” can apply to almost anything. Almost.">

    <h1>Uplifting products</h1>

    <p>You may not know it, but I created apps. I started learning how to code three years ago, and a year ago, I
        published my first app, a mental math app, followed by an app designed for the older generation. In this period,
        I made the slogan “Improve mental math.” Today, however, this changed to “Uplifting products.” I believe this
        slogan is more expressive and authentic than my intentions.</p>

    <p>Today, few brands stand out because of their uncompromising quality, environmental concerns, and commitment to
        workers' rights. A brand’s moral obligation is to comply with the highest standards possible. While that might
        not always be possible, it should be strived for. </p>

    <p>I don’t believe in degrading products. I don’t think so in products degrading one’s health, soul, freedom, and
        integrity, as well as the workers and the environment. If I had created a destructive business, I wouldn’t have
        been able to sleep in peace at night. </p>

    <p>That's why I think creating a company with a genuine intent that prioritizes uplifting products is more than just
        a business strategy. I am convinced that producing products that enhance someone's life is the only ethical way
        to conduct business. Your products should not just be good; they should excel in every field and be a source of
        inspiration for the soul. Your brand needs to lead by example.</p>

    <p>As I envision a future with sustainable companies selling uplifting products, exceptional marketing is not just a
        tool but a necessity. It's the key to not just promoting a brand but solidifying its
        <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a> and ensuring that the message of improvement reaches far and wide.
