    <h1>The art of less</h1>

    <p>Most people have zero essentialism in their lives. Their indulgence knows no bounds. Their lives and minds are
        cluttered and unpure. They mistake consumerism for happiness, seeking comfort at all costs on an endless quest
        to satisfy their insatiable <a href="blog_33.html">desire</a> for instant gratification. They want to fill
        themselves up, but that rarely
        leads to fulfillment. It's an endless trap.
    </p>

    <p><em>Our kitchen has a cooking aggregate that supposedly simplifies cooking. It has been standing aimlessly in our
            kitchen for half a decade. It cost eighty hours’ worth of my mother’s life—eighty hours are gone—eighty
            hours!
            How does that not ignite fury? That’s how a life is wasted.</em>
    </p>

    <p>Most work jobs they don’t like to buy products they don’t need. So, if objects don’t bring happiness, what does?
        Maybe lying on the beach and overeating do?
    </p>

    <p>I disagree. I refuse to accept that working a pointless job, buying useless products, and lying around is how
        life is meant to be lived.
    </p>

    <p>Luckily, many reach the maturity level to understand that most objects aren’t necessary. They recognize the
        importance of less. I like to use mental exercises: Would I carry something over a mountain? Such is the test of
        whether something is essential.</p>

    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">*****</p>

    <p>The art of less exceeds mere material possessions.<br> It’s an entire approach to life.
    </p>

    <p>Essentialism is about finding happiness in nothing. It’s a reflection of the power of the indomitable spirit.
        It's about finding joy in the absence of pleasure, in discomfort. Most try to view life as a game to maximize
        pleasure. But that’s like swimming against the current, since the taste of life is pain.
    </p>

    <p>Yes, instant gratification doesn’t lead anywhere. However, the concept of delayed gratification also has its
        limits. For example, if someone delays gratification and works hard to become wealthy solely to indulge in more
        extravagant parties, that form of gratification is still superficial. Once they acclimate to their new
        lifestyle, the initial excitement fades, and they find themselves in the same place as before—seeking
        satisfaction through external means. True fulfillment comes not from the mere postponement of pleasure but from
        pursuing deeper, more meaningful goals that contribute to lasting personal growth and contentment. So, the
        meditative approach to life eliminates the pursuit of shallow pleasure altogether.
    </p>

    <p>Essentialism is about abandoning the search for happiness. It’s about the pursuit of uncompromising excellence.
    </p>

    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">*****</p>

    <p>I'm a simple man; I don't need much. I am happy with the life I have built myself, and I regret very little. I
        enjoy every lived second. I write, record videos, and do sports, and that’s it. I don’t need anything else.
        Precisely because I live the simplest life, I have the craziest stories.
    </p>

    <p>The more I let go of it, the faster I become. Subtraction accelerates. Uncompromising excellence, effortless
        ease, and timeless simplicity create an abundant life.
    </p>

    <p>Recently, I got a gift card for a bookstore. I started to think of the books I wanted to buy. Then it hit me: I’m
        overthinking which book to buy even though I have books left to read? That’s unessential. I gave my gift card
        away. Reality likes to reward the giving. A few days later, a girl gifted me a philosophical book.
    </p>

    <p>The art of less requires discipline. How else can one resist endless temptations? Well, but then let’s think
        further. How can one maintain this discipline? With purpose. Because writing is my current purpose, I don’t need
        anything else. Without direction in life, it’s impossible to resist life’s temptations.
    </p>

    <p>I let go of as much as possible. Everyone has twenty-four hours; some make the most out of them, while others
        keep making excuses. Excellence is the art of doing without trying; it is the art of effortless action.
        Excellence comes from focus; <a href="blog_3.html">focus</a> from saying no. I encourage you to say no to more
        things. Behind every no,
        there’s a deeper yes.
    </p>

    <p>What’s the <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a> of meditation? To let go of pointless thoughts. Stillness is
        clarity.
    </p>

    <p>What’s the point of essentialism? It’s simple. The point of needing less is liberty. The art of less is vital to
        a fulfilling life.
