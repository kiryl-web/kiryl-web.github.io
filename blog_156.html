    <h1>Declaration of November
    </h1>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>

    <p>Your growth as a person is directly proportional to the amount of suffering you are willing to take on
        voluntarily. If you want to live a life no one has, you must do things no one else does. Such is the way of
        excellence.
    </p>

    <p>It’s my third week of university, and I’m willing to announce a goal: Instead of completing my studies in five
        years, I’ll do it in four.
    </p>

    <p>I understand that this goal is nearly impossible, but I must try regardless of the potential to fall short. Most
        things in life don’t matter, yet peace of mind isn’t one of them. Peace of mind, however, is only reserved for
        those who live up to their potential.
    </p>

    <p>I believe I can do it, for I have done exceptional things before. I finished 12th grade at sixteen with a perfect
        high school diploma. I have had two failed businesses, the first of which I started at thirteen. I’ve been on
        self-improvement for four years and have grown across all realms.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. On having a purpose</strong></p>

    <p>I didn't document my thoughts when I skipped 9th grade or started my first business. Now, I’m presented with a
        unique opportunity to do so.
    </p>

    <p>Why do I want to study harder to finish university earlier?
    </p>

    <p>{1} I’m a true philosopher. As such, I like to think strategically. How much would someone pay for a year with
        peak energy and health and is that money worth studying a bit harder? Besides, it won’t be too hard because
        pressure increases one’s capacity to perform.
    </p>

    <p>{2} My name is Kiryl P., and I must ensure it means something. I have things to prove and hot blondes to impress.
        I must become the best version of myself. I must live up to that which I am talking about. I must make my future
        self proud. I will need time to become a monumental person.
    </p>

    <p>{3} Move faster, get further. Because I move quickly, I live longer. I skipped 9th grade because I understood
        what speed meant.
    </p>

    <p>{4} I have no goals. I have no ‘five-year plan,’ and I have never had one. I’m not concerned about winning, for
        I’m playing a different game: The point of working is to work. Those who work to win quit as soon as they are
        given their win. But I’m built for the battlefield. This is life, and things will never get easier. I don’t want
        to win; I want to dominate.
    </p>

    <p>{5} My favorite emotion is the way the golden leaves dance in the year’s last sunshine. Imagine working on
        something for years, exhausting yourself, to get a few breaths of perfect stillness - a heartbeat suspended in
        time, beyond pain and pleasure, with nothing but beauty all around. Such is fulfillment, fleeting yet permanent.
    </p>

    <p>{6} I want a life where there’s nothing left to give. I want to die without potential, without things I could
        have done. I want to give everything there is to give: Naked I was born, naked, I shall die.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Conclusion</strong></p>

    <p>I cannot give up; I cannot fatigue, for my resilience knows no bounds. Change is my ally, time my greatest
        advantage. Uncompromising excellence is a true testament to the indomitability of my spirit.
    </p>
