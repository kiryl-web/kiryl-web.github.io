    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Pursue what is meaningful</h1>

    <h1>Desire</h1>

    <p><em>The sun shines, and the clouds float elegantly. I sit in the open. Behind me grows a lush green forest of
            resilient trees. To the front, the grass moves like ballet. To the sides, I can see unyielding mountains.
            The warm breeze touches my heart; that’s the place I call home. I observe the symphony of nature and the
            eternal cycles of life. Amongst the trees, I felt at peace. </em></p>

    <p>I believe a good life is meant to be lived by the deepest realization. A life unassed, lived by primal desire, is
        an understatement of God’s creation. Chase the wrong things, and they will start to chase you. </p>

    <p>Desire is almost always a shadow of its true self. One can see the shape but not its form, its manifestation but
        not its reality. The nature of the universe is too complex to be grasped. You don’t know what you truly desire.
    </p>

    <p>Many teachings claim desire is the cause of all pain. That’s why a state free of desire is the highest goal. This
        is not true. Desire is neither good nor bad. </p>

    <p>Without desire, there is no point in being alive. The clouds float without passion, mountains rise without
        ambition, and stars glow without direction – they are free of desire and lifeless.As long as life exists, it
        strives. Denying passion leads to a mundane existence. The days with the most passion are the most beautiful
        ones, the ones without desire drain. Life is meant to be a perpetual struggle. After attaining a goal, the
        single second of pleasure yields boundless fulfillment, nullifying every pain. Climbing a mountain to see its
        view is always worth it. Strive, be passionate, and be driven by a burning desire. </p>

    <p>Every desire causes pain. Pain can be change, growth, and the price for endless fulfillment. The ancients weren’t
        entirely false in their connection between desire and pain. False and unattainable desire, detached from one’s
        core, brings no deep fulfillment. Such shallow desire causes endless cycles of pain because it yields very
        little pleasure after attainment. These cycles can be broken by finding your core.</p>

    <p>To live a deep life, you must always own your desires. Owning your desire means being true to yourself. Your
        desire is confused if you cannot say it in front of a thousand people. Some desires feel inauthentic when they
        are spoken out loud. When brought to the surface, many manifestations disappear. Hence, you must strive to get
        closer to your core. Assess where your desire comes from, where they lead, and whether they are valid. True
        desire stems from sources inexplicable and, therefore, cannot be grasped with ease.</p>

    <p>What is your core, what does it do, and where can it be found? These are the questions that stir the depths of
        our being, yet remain elusive. If I only knew…</p>

    <p>It takes one night to question everything. The price of avoiding <a href="blog_111.html">reflection</a> is too
        great to pay, a life of
        mistakes.</p>

    <p>The deepest realization remains beyond grasp.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; width: 50%;"><em> I continued with my
            meditation out in the open as the sun began to set. As gently as a butterfly
            landing, the light touched my soul.</em></p>
