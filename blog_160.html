    <h1>The art of studying</h1>

    <p><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1. On purpose</strong></p>

    <p>
        Without a mold, gold has no form.
        <br>Without a scaffold, the building cannot rise.
        <br>Without a target, the arrow strays.
        <br>
        <br>The inferior man studies to pass a test;
        <br>his purpose, shallow yet clear.
        <br>The mediocre man studies for accolades;
        <br>victory is his only desire.
        <br>What nonsense!
        <br>
        <br>The superior man seeks the essence,
        <br>pursuing wisdom over details.
        <br>A vision is the mold, the scaffold, the target—
        <br>that which shapes all effort.
        <br>To hold the vision is intrinsic strength;
        <br>to forget it, the root of failure.
        <br>
        <br>All things cannot be mastered,
        <br>for time is short and knowledge vast.
        <br>Thus, compromises need to be made.
        <br>But what’s important?
        <br>Hold fast to the vision.
        <br>Through it, discern what must be done.
        <br>

    <p><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. On iteration</strong></p>

    <p>
        Wisdom is not a gift;
        <br>intelligence is no birthright.
        <br>What men call genius is the fruit of repetition.
        <br>
        <br>It is easy to seek refuge in excuses.
        <br>Yet it is simple: Consistency precedes excellence.
        <br>One must first walk the path of repetition.
        <br>
        <br>The next time something seems hard,
        <br>imagine performing a hundred times.
        <br>It will come at ease.
        <br>To think deeply is fleeting;
        <br>to repeat, everlasting.
        <br>Mastery is born of the familiar,
        <br>where rules vanish into instinct.
        <br>It's not about thinking hard,
        <br>it's about internalizing.
        <br>
        <br>The next time something seems hard,
        <br>do it anyway.
        <br>When the path is hard,
        <br>walk it regardless.
        <br>Get consistent with hardship.
        <br>The other side is often very close.
        <br>Before invention, lies iteration.
        <br>The pain of repetition manifest improvement,
        <br>forcing your mind to find a better way.
        <br>
        <br>Don’t remember what you read?
        <br>Read again.
        <br>
        <br>Don’t know how something works?
        <br>Study how others have done it.
        <br>Then, try again.
        <br>
        <br>Don’t know where to start?
        <br>Assess your roots.
        <br>Stupidity is not real;
        <br>it is the shadow of ignorance.
        <br>
        <br>Don’t want to keep going?
        <br>Take a deep breath and resume.
        <br>That’s what hard feels like.
        <br>No one said it was going to be easy.
        <br>
        <br>Where knowledge is lacking,
        <br>resolve is the cure.
        <br>How does one overcome?
        <br>By sitting down,
        <br>and beginning anew.
        <br>
        <br>Hence, frustration is the very essence of growth.

    <p><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. On the power of the will.</strong></p>

    <p>
        My mind was a leaking vessel.
        <br>How did I overcome?
        <br>By taking responsibility.
        <br>The mind obeys its master.
        <br>I said to myself, "My memory is strong,"
        <br>and so it became.
        <br>Before, it had not been trained;
        <br>of course it faltered.
        <br>Now it got trained.
        <br>
        <br>I had problems doing math in the head.
        <br>So, I stopped using a calculator.
        <br>Guess what happened?
        <br>The numbers flowed;
        <br>the mind awakened.
        <br>
        <br>I like the way the universe works.
        <br>With enough determination,
        <br>almost everything can be overcome.
        <br>
        <br>The root of all learning is willingness.
        <br>Willingness is a tree,
        <br>its trunk, discipline.
        <br>Its fruit, the power to endure.
        <br>
        <br>Suffering cannot be escaped,
        <br>but through it,
        <br>the soul learns to endure
        <br>and to thrive.

    <p><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. On the monumental insignificance of almost everything </strong></p>

    <p>
        To study for an exam is a noble task,
        <br>yet one must not forsake the greater truths of life.
        <br>
        <br>What value is there in being the master of something insignificant?
        <br>It is more important to add one with one when it matters
        <br>then it is to solve the most difficult of equations.
        <br>
        <br>Exams are but a mirror,
        <br>their purpose not the mastery of answers,
        <br>but the cultivation of learning.
        <br>
        <br>To learn the way of learning is to hold the key to all things.
        <br>
        <br>Complacency reaches those who act on despair.
        <br>When things get easy,
        <br>push hard.
