  <h1><strong>What a journey taught me</strong></h1>

  <p>Although it was May, Vienna, the capital of Austria, greeted us with grey skies and chilly weather. My family and I arrived at our hotel on the evening of Wednesday, May 17, 2023. 
  </p>

  <p>The next day, we began exploring the city. We toured Vienna aboard a sightseeing bus, and I dedicated the rest of the day to the mental math app I’m building and the self-improvement videos I’m creating. I love my work; however, my productivity fell short of my expectations since I had no desk.
  </p>

  <p>Friday arrived with a welcome transformation. The clouds had dissolved, leaving the sky a pristine blue. The sun's warmth kissed my skin as I stepped outside. I strolled through the heart of the city, captivated by its familiar architecture. Adding to the old-world charm were horses pulling carriages, with the echo of hooves striking the cobblestone. As I observed the horses, something caught my attention: their black blinders. Why did those horses have blinders? Well, it’s simple. These horses were meant to look forward, not backward or to the side. Otherwise, they would only end up confused and irritated. That moment, I was struck by insight: I realized that these horses mirrored the nature of progress itself. Their aperture was narrow; thus, their progress was inevitable - to narrow the aperture is to speed up. 
  </p>

  <p>I like to feel like an arrow—fast and precise. Letting go is imperative to moving forward – a lighter boat goes faster. You go where you look; hence, you must look where you want to go. A narrow perspective sharpens your resolve. Cut out the noise, disregard the alternatives— <em>focus</em>.
