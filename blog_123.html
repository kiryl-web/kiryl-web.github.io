    <h1>The dance with complacency</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Notes from Sunday, 17.3.2024.</em></strong> Today, I walked for approximately 6 hours, 32 kilometers.
        The weather was perfect, it was sunny, and the temperature was just right. I took many beautiful photos. After
        walking for 4 hours, I stopped to eat ice cream. I enjoyed it without my conscience thrashing me for being
        undisciplined. Instead, I ate the ice cream as if I were a normal 16-year-old. Something unbelievable a few
        months ago.</p>

    <h1>1. Fries are tasty</h1>

    <p>Let me start with a little story.
    </p>

    <p>A couple of days ago, I drove, via driving school, to a town around one hour away from where I live. It was a
        sunny day, and the car's open roof allowed the warm air to flow in, creating a blissful atmosphere. The sun,
        hanging low in the sky, added a golden hue to the journey. The villages we drove through were quiet and
        peaceful. The rivers, reflecting the late afternoon sky, were a deep, saturated blue. As we drove, the energetic
        music filled us with speed and exhilaration. Driving is a feeling like no other; the effortless speed amazes me.
        Eventually, we arrived. The driving instructor and I took a break at a parking lot while ordering coffee and
        fries. Not having eaten fries in five years, the taste made me reminiscent of my childhood. As we stood outside
        of the bistro, I felt happy. Music, speed, relaxation, warm weather, birds singing, golden light, and
        magnificent villages. It’s impossible to be melancholic when the sun shines, and you eat fries in a parking lot.
    </p>

    <p>I did not have a voice annoying me about the shallowness of this pleasure. I simply enjoyed this Friday afternoon
        and was fully present while doing so.
    </p>

    <p>This event got me thinking. Why do I need riches, hot blondes, the gym, meditation, and monumental success if I
        can be happy with fries in the parking lot?
    </p>

    <p>What push hard for if, in the end, I end up liking the shallower forms of existence? I can go for walks without
        being successful. I can look at the sun without a million in the bank. I can play with my future children
        without living in a palace. Quite the opposite - getting successful could rob me of the things I enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>This is my fourth year of self-improvement. I'm at a level where I'm kind of happy with what I have. I don’t have
        any real problems anymore. It seems I’ve reached my ideal lifestyle. So, what should I try hard for? But the
        problem is that this <a href="blog_69.html">stagnation</a> makes me rot from within; only a silent voice keeps
        telling me I should be more.
        The problem is that this whisper can be ignored. It may not be painful enough to cause change. If this voice is
        ignored long enough, it fades away. That’s when one forgets one had dreams in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>This is a journey where I discover how to keep going after arriving.
    </p>

    <p>The enemy, a mighty one, is complacency.
    </p>

    <h1>2. Desperation so large it's my entire story</h1>

    <p>This is my first time combating complacency; here’s how I got there.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.1. Painful start</strong></p>

    <p>When I was 13, at the end of 2020, I had nothing except problems. I had zero social skills, no muscle, negative
        status, and no income. My body was so weak that I couldn’t run any distance without getting a side stitch. I was
        bitter and isolated. Neither did I have any passions; nothing really interested me. I didn’t even read. I was
        annoyed with all the trauma I had. I didn’t like how I had no independence either.
    </p>

    <p>I had many problems. I was deeply dissatisfied with my life.
    </p>

    <p>That’s why I started to grip my life. I wanted to get more out of it. I didn't want to live the average life
        under any circumstances. I didn't want to peak at a party. I had amassed infinite dissatisfaction. I tried to
        distance myself from all of the nonsense. I couldn't imagine myself living an ordinary life. - This
        dissatisfaction gave me energy and purpose. That was the start of my self-improvement.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.2. Pushing super hard</strong></p>

    <p>When I was 13, I had a vision. I would create apps and market them on social media. That’s perspicacity at its
        finest because, in 2020, no one was talking about entrepreneurship and self-improvement online. I even skipped
        9th grade to finish 12th grade at 16 years old and have more time to become monumentally successful. I had the
        perfect conditions to push super hard. My stark superiority complex made me want more. Deep dissatisfaction
        justified any hardship. Traumas – cool, that’s motivation. Coupled with a vision, I kept myself on track.
    </p>

    <p>I worked up to 14 hours a day, mostly dedicated to programming. After three months, I needed a short break, and I
        focused on studying Chinese and creating videos. By then, it was mid-2021, and my programming course had
        started. My life got hard. I enrolled in a programming course designed for professionals. I struggled to keep
        up. In parallel, I had skipped 9th grade and wasn’t used to the new expectations; I was two years younger than
        the other 10th graders. My mother worsened my situation by forcing me to go to a swimming club and she made me
        to waste time with math tutors – that’s the last thing I needed. I can’t describe the resentment I built. – Yet,
        this very resentment made me withstand the stress. The pressure kept rising, but I kept going.
    </p>

    <p><em>When you are under pressure, there’s no time to be sad. When you are under pressure, life feels like you’re
            walking on a narrow, hot sand trail surrounded by cacti. Behind you, there’s a tiger. Blood is guaranteed,
            but much less if you keep going.</em>
    </p>

    <p>My mother wanted me to quit my dreams. I refused to listen, as that would undo a year of self-improvement. I kept
        going, and I was proven right. Eventually, the pressure got less because I got stronger and faster. I’m
        infinitely grateful I didn’t quit. If I had, I would not have been; my bitterness would have eaten me.
    </p>

    <p>I remember nothing taught by this programming course, but I learned how to learn. After that course ended, I
        started to focus on videos for the second time. I created 375 timelapse and slow-motion short videos in 60 days
        to demonstrate my power and got over 600.000 views. I abandoned this project as I failed to innovate and began
        to stagnate. Then, I started to work on my first app.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.3. Don’t forget this story is about pain</strong></p>

    <p>My story could have ended at any time; things weren’t as straightforward as I described them to be. In my
        childhood, I wanted to be a scientist, and everyone kept reinforcing that identity – teachers, parents, and
        classmates. After my entrepreneurial vision at age 13, I still had a not-so-small desire to be a scientist, a
        relic from a bygone era.
    </p>

    <p>It was part of the 10th-grade school curriculum to do an internship. I interned at my local university in the
        computer science and electronics department for two weeks.
    </p>

    <p>Dear heavens!
    </p>

    <p>Nothing less than my entire reality collapsed in on itself.
    </p>

    <p>I never wanted anything to do with science ever again. I can see how someone can like science, there’s nothing
        wrong with it, but that was not me. I didn't exactly hate the internship, but it felt dramatically out of place.
        I didn’t like the mentality of the people there. Neither did I like their lifestyles. I didn’t want to spend my
        life in a lab. I realized that I actually hated science, technology, and engineering. My entire childhood was an
        illusion. Searching for ‘the truth’ using the scientific method seemed like a joke to me. What truth? – A
        checkered shirt and glasses? That’s not me. I couldn’t imagine spending my life in a cubic building trying to
        look purposeful. Everything I valued turned out to be a lie.
    </p>

    <p>I had enough. I couldn’t imagine anything worse than doing science. Hence, generating enough energy to get out of
        bed seemed trivial. From now on, I had to commit every lived second to ensure this was not my destiny. This is
        not how I wanted to live.
    </p>

    <p>Removing the possibility of failure establishes the certainty of success.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.4. The hardest I had ever worked</strong></p>

    <p>After this internship, my summer holidays started. I got back to work on my first app—a mental math app with
        games. Full of pain once more, I pushed harder than ever before. My days became grueling because I cut
        out the cute and shallow work. Retrospectively, I don’t know how I was able to do it, because now I couldn’t do
        it. After two months of tedious, arduous, never-ending work, I published my first app. </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.5. The best time of my life</strong></p>

    <p>My app was far from done, and as 11th grade started, I was still very annoyed. I may have worked like a
        psychopath. But I looked like a geek. I had never done any sports, I had severe acne and a chubby face, my
        health was bad, and my body couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t even do five pushups. I hated being weak. So, I did
        pushups whenever I ran into an issue while developing my app. Whenever I wanted to quit, I ran outside to the
        playground and did some pullups. That’s how I started to do 50 pullups and 150 pushups a day. Because my mind
        was already hardened, I didn’t need rest days. This would continue for 90 days, until December 2022, when I was
        15 years old.
    </p>

    <p>In December 2022, many things began to change. I was fed up with wasting hours a day scrolling social media. My
        screen time was around two hours a day, and before I got on self-improvement at the age of 13, it was more like
        6 or 8 hours. I estimated to have wasted a year's worth of my time online, which was painful enough for me to
        break free three months later. I was also fed up with no social skills, so I began to develop them.
    </p>

    <p>Skipping a few amazing months ahead, I fell in love with a girl, which motivated me to develop even faster
        because I knew I wasn’t attractive enough to get her.
    </p>

    <p>I thought I had reached the ideal life. I had eliminated every bad habit. I progressed in my projects and social
        skills quickly. I had a purpose. I trained like a beast in the gym, and I started to read, journal, and
        meditate…
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.6. How we got to where I am today</strong></p>

    <p>After 31 months, or around 900 days of work and uninterrupted self-improvement, I was 16 years old. I hit
        a point where everything went downhill. I started to feel sad at random. What was I missing?
    </p>

    <p>I got my first rejection in June 2023. This time, the phrase “hot blonde” is literal and not a metaphor for love
        and having a purpose. From my current perspective, I also know that the purpose of my app business had started
        to end because I had changed too much. Now, I wanted love—hot blonde—not riches.
    </p>

    <p>Because my purpose ended, burning out was inevitable. I was completely useless for ten days, and my performance
        stayed low for an entire month.
    </p>

    <p>Still, I used that pain to grow. For three months, I had a discipline I had never seen before. I was strong
        enough to cut out everything, even music. I had an absolutely beautiful summer.
    </p>

    <p>Then, in August 2023, as a 16-year-old, I wanted to close the chapter with the apps. After confronting my biggest
        fears, I was ready. I started several ad campaigns; I concluded that my apps weren’t in demand.
    </p>

    <p>After a few blissful weeks, my life started to go downhill. I completely lost my discipline already at the
        beginning of September, to the death time of my first app. I grew weaker by the day. I started to wonder why I
        was working hard when the girl bragged about an alcoholic vape loser and how much time they wanted to spend
        together. I wasn’t even close to overcoming her and so it hurt badly. Being surrounded by my classmates on a
        school trip to Venice weakened my spirit. Back in Germany, that inner conflict around that girl started to eat
        me from within, especially because I was already weakened because my <a href="blog_50.html">first business</a>
        failed.
    </p>

    <p>There was a lot of dissatisfaction, but I could not transmute it into productivity. I kept trying to get up but
        fell down frequently. At one point, I couldn’t even go to the gym anymore because I was so sick.
    </p>

    <p>Getting up at 3:30 helped strengthen me because it made me write beautiful texts. The 50 videos in 90 days
        project, which ended successfully on February 29th, also helped me.
    </p>

    <p>Suffering from heartbreak for months on end also weakened my superiority complex. God Himself must have sent her
        to make that clear. I’ve been humbled.
    </p>

    <p>At the same time, I loved my lifestyle of reading, thinking, writing, going to the gym, and recording videos. But
        because writing and creating videos is difficult, you can’t do it for more than three hours daily. So having
        nothing better to do, I started spending more time with friends. I also started becoming more interested in
        spirituality, literature, and philosophy. My life felt good; for example, one time in January, I went to the
        opera with a few classmates, and I liked it very much.
    </p>

    <p>I had no burning pain anymore, as I did at the beginning of my journey. I seemed to have fixed every flaw. I had
        now developed social skills, skills to put on a resume, and a six-pack. I was now getting quite comfortable. Was
        the purpose of my self-improvement complete? Was I now able to return to the normal path? Remembering what nine
        hundred days of work felt like, I wasn’t sure whether I wanted them ever again. What do I need success for if I
        can have fun without it?
    </p>

    <p>Growing content wasn’t as painful as I thought it would be.
    </p>

    <p>You see, why cut out friends, <a href="blog_13.html">sacrifice</a> cake, get up at three, and work all day long?
        This is not meant as a
        rhetorical question. Genuinely. Why give up everything to reach success? Everyone knows that a goal turns
        indifferent the second you reach it, so why try? Why not get comfortable with the simple life?
    </p>

    <p>Maybe a simple life is all one needs.
    </p>

    <p>Maybe that’s how life was meant to be lived.
    </p>

    <p><em>Sigh…</em>
    </p>

    <p>But then,
    </p>

    <p>I realized that this was just a test. I got tempted by comfort. I don’t want a normal life; it’s boring and
        unfulfilling. I’m not meant to live an ordinary life. I almost would have failed. This was a test of whether I
        could hold the frame. This was a test of whether my journey was about fixing my life or about more. This was a
        test of whether I could keep going without pain.
    </p>

    <p>I realized it was a test, and now I'm back.
    </p>

    <p>Did I pass?
    </p>

    <h1>3. The pain of complacency</h1>

    <p>After my meditation, I concluded that I could summarize this text in one sentence.
    </p>

    <p><em>“Let’s go and buy some furniture on the weekend.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>This statement is the epitome of an emasculating existence. Here’s why: Normal people like to work boring jobs to
        buy things they don’t need. Decade-long risk aversion, coupled with an insatiable desire for instant
        gratification, indeed kills the soul. The man who, against his will, spends his weekend in a furniture store has
        lost his direction in life, the very definition of a masculine core. Forced into submission by his mediocre
        wife, he becomes the embodiment of complacency.
    </p>

    <p>I struggle to believe that comfort is the solution to life’s inherent discomfort.
    </p>

    <p>Let’s dive deeper into the realm of philosophy. One of my core values is ‘the deepest realization,’ in other
        words, ‘life is paradise,’ ‘only reality is good,’ or ‘only pursue what is meaningful.’ – I don’t think that
        life is about pleasure. There are no stories in the absence of pain. If you were put in paradise, you would
        probably be miserable. There’s nothing meaningful to do in paradise. Hence, anyone trying to optimize their life
        for comfort and happiness usually grows miserable.
    </p>

    <p>From another philosophical perspective, things need to evolve continually. Complacency is standstill, and
        standstill is deadly. Things either grow or deteriorate. A house doesn’t grow; hence it breaks apart after a few
        decades of neglect. A tree does grow, and it can survive for millennia. I believe the same concept applies to
        humans.
    </p>

    <p>The body works best if trained. Most people don’t train anything. The mind works performs if it is fed. Many
        people haven’t read a book in years. Adventure nurtures the soul. Most live boring lives. When was the last time
        your parents did something outstanding? Let me hypothesize something.
        I think think that the number of real books your father reads is correlated with how much sex your parents have.
        Why do I believe that, you may ask? Well, the man who stops learning and who gives up on life is inherently
        unattractive. There’s no purpose left.
    </p>

    <p>Complacency is a very special form of weakness. Normal weakness is not being brave enough to ask out your crush.
        Complacency is a step above that. It’s not wanting to ask her out in the first place. Somehow, the life energy
        gets turned off. That means to cure complacency, one needs to rethink everything.
    </p>

    <p>Before we rethink everything, let me explain two concepts.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Contentment</strong> means being happy with one’s life. There’s nothing wrong with being happy in life.
        Some people work a fulfilling job, have a beautiful wife, sometimes even a hot blonde, and are satisfied. I
        think that playing board games with friends on a Friday afternoon, having hobbies, going to the gym, and reading
        brings almost complete—95%—life satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Complacency</strong> means settling for less because one gave up. Complacency means not having enough
        energy to leave the bed. Complacency is comfort on a paralyzing level. Complacency is categorically bad. Life is
        meant to be lived in motion. Life is striving; life is energy. But complacency turns that energy off. Thus,
        complacency kills the soul.
    </p>

    <p>To give a practical example, if I were to go to university and become some random employee, I would be complacent
        because that’s not my dream. I would need to give up on my dreams to become an engineer. Someone may aspire to
        be an engineer and be content – happy – once they are.
    </p>

    <p>So, now let’s reinvent the universe.
    </p>

    <h1>4. What made me complacent </h1>

    <p>Let’s start simply before we dive very deep into what creates complacency.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.1. Complacency happens to everyone </strong></p>

    <p>Before we get super deep again, I want to introduce a rather practical concept. Complacency comes in stages.
        Understanding these stages is crucial to break them.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Pain creates positive change.</li>
        <li>Positive change creates complacency.</li>
        <li>Complacency creates pain.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here’s an example.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The views are low, so I produce a good video.</li>
        <li>This video performs and restores my engagement.</li>
        <li>Slowly, the views fall again.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here’s a second example.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Working out made my muscles grow, and I can now run for quite a long time.</li>
        <li>Now, missing training once won’t change anything, right?</li>
        <li>Performance drops.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>How can this cycle be broken? By doing regardless of how you feel. That means you keep trying, no matter if you
        succeed or not. You keep training no matter how fit you feel. You keep recording videos, even if you start
        getting views. You keep doing impressive things, even after you get your hot blonde.</p>


    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.2. Fake exhaustion</strong></p>

    <p>Let me give you a very practical tip. Has your life felt seemingly sad for no reason? Have you ever felt as if
        life isn’t fun anymore? I’ve learned that there’s most likely no deeper problem. I could fix my low drive by
        eating and sleeping more. That’s how I left my philosophical phase in the winter. Literally – by eating more.
        So, a potential solution to your complacency can be eating more.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.3. Growing up, in other words, losing one's passion. </strong></p>

    <p><em>“I refuse to accept the normal life. I want more. Growing up is a lie. Everything is a lie. Everything is
            trying to strip me of my energy. I refuse to let that happen.”
        </em></p>

    <p><em>“No, you will grow up and realize that you’re wrong. The world is not as straightforward as it's tempting to
            think. Enjoy the wonders of being young and innocent. Sunsets are vibrant, but when you grow up, not so much
            anymore. Love is passionate as a kid, but then it all evaporates. That's how life is. The sky is starry when
            you are young.”
        </em></p>

    <p>I look out the window when I’m on a train, bus, or car. I enjoy seeing the shiny drops when it rains and the sun
        shines. It's a moment of intimacy with nature when these drops change color, especially when they turn a warm
        golden, leaving a simple and beautiful impression. Often, I'm the only person truly present. Everyone else has
        “grown up” and now sits on their phone, busy.
    </p>

    <p>No child will authentically state they want their parent's lives. I’ve never seen someone desiring to spend their
        life filling out documents and attending pointless meetings. That has never happened.
    </p>

    <p><em>“Can’t have a purposeful life? Here, eat some fries in the parking lot instead. You will never make it;
            you’re not a part of the elite. The elites aren’t happy anyway. Here, grow up.”
        </em></p>

    <p>What’s faster, going three miles or one? Going three miles is faster in practice because walking it would take
        too long.
    </p>

    <p>I'm scared of university. Currently, I hate science, engineering, and being a nerd. I feel disgusted when I
        reflect on who I was before my four-year self-improvement. – Being asexual, analytical, and asocial was
        terrible. But, then, there’s a problem. I may get used to it. I may go back to the easy path. I may not reach
        the disgust threshold to risk it all. Eating sweets doesn't kill you. Growing up means losing one’s energy.
        Growing up means losing one’s speed. Growing up means losing one’s flexibility. That’s why university is an
        existential threat to me. If I indeed become an employee, I will delete every text and video and give away my
        camera and microphone because my philosophy would turn out incorrect. Amen.
    </p>


    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.4. Time to let go of friends </strong></p>

    <p>Now let’s go deep again.
    </p>

    <p>I used to be supremely elitist, arrogant, cold, and judgmental. Simultaneously, I progressed very quickly in my
        self-improvement. However, that changed in late October 2023, year three of my journey. I felt broken after that
        girl bragged about an alcoholic and how great he supposedly was. In the next few months, I fluctuated between
        humility and arrogance. Towards the end, humility won. Now I'm at a point where people don’t believe me when I
        tell them I'm arrogant. I became warm, charismatic, and open. I started to like people.
    </p>

    <p>Yet, that humility was very expensive. Why push hard if you don’t see yourself as destined for more? What do you
        need to compensate for? Why push hard if you’re insignificant and no one awaits you? Why push hard when love is
        in abundance? A crushed ego may have made me social, warm, and charming, but at what cost?
    </p>

    <p>Being social was expensive, too. Suddenly, I let in weakness. Suddenly, I spent time with undisciplined,
        purposeless, and unambitious people. Now, it was normal to be mediocre. I allowed myself to get infected by
        weakness. That weakness opened the gate for negativity to enter, and I paid the price. – A stark decline in my
        discipline, performance, and, ultimately, well-being. Now my mind was no longer a castle, fortified against
        demons. Previously, I would have judged their weakness so hard that it would be impossible to be friends. But
        now, I accepted them for who they were. My protective wall of arrogance collapsed.
    </p>

    <p>At the same time, having friends was beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>So, how do I solve this problem? – How do I make sure I don’t absorb weak energy? – How can I marry performance
        and friendships? – How do I stop friends from making me complacent?
    </p>

    <p>Firstly, I rethought what humility meant because a crushed ego made my life depressive. From now on, humility
        doesn’t mean ‘crushed ego’ but ‘caring more about others.’ That should make being social and driven possible at
        the same time.
    </p>

    <p>Secondly, I will now only discuss self-improvement, discipline, and purpose with my friends. If I cut out talking
        about communism, feminism, and climate change – I know, my all-time favorite topics – it should become clear who
        cares about me as a person.
    </p>

    <p>Perhaps I should raise my standards.
    </p>

    <p>Thirdly, I will restore my broken ego by pushing harder on my self-improvement. I will also stop bending myself
        to please others. If others want less, they can go and find less somewhere different.
    </p>

    <p>As I thought deeply, I found another issue on the social front. How do I ensure that I won't grow complacent if I
        get a woman? I can be romantic without millions. I’m supremely motivated because I want to become attractive, so
        getting a woman will pose a new threat. I guess the temptation to grow complacent will only grow bigger. Now
        it’s a battle. Who will win? Will uncompromising excellence remain a testament to my spirit's indomitability, or
        will my spirit break? I don’t know.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.5. Distractions</strong></p>

    <p><em>“I never liked water, the beach, or the sea. One may think I should like the beach; after all, seeing young
            women without bras is almost a sublime experience as a teenager. The glances from everyone looking at the
            physique my lifestyle gave me were also nice. Unfortunately, that isn’t very meaningful. You know, young
            braless women are nice, but I would rather work.”
        </em></p>

    <p>I wrote that at the height of my discipline in the summer of 2023.
    </p>

    <p>Spending an hour on the beach can be nice. But three hours…?
    </p>

    <p>People like to be busy. Having nothing to do is one of the worst feelings one can have. That’s another reason
        paradise is undesirable; there’s nothing to do there. This is a law of the universe. Where there’s nothing to
        do, people will find ways to busy themselves. The magnum opus – the prime example – of pointless tasks are
        hobbies. For example, pets, gardening, or the volleyball club. Those things don’t produce anything, and neither
        do they add value. Although, … in my opinion, a garden is worse than useless because helping my parents actively
        wastes my time. Yet still, working in a garden is almost like being productive. When we broaden this point,
        almost everything people do is pointless. I suppose humans planted seeds so that they could feel productive.
    </p>

    <p>Now, let’s think deeper. I want success in life because normal life is boring. That means if we make the average
        person busy, the desire for success should go away. If we are busy and distract the average person, they will
        not feel bored, so stupendously, they will pursue success in life.
    </p>

    <p><em>Why not do the laundry?<br>
            Why not pick up the children from kindergarten?<br>
            Why not buy some furniture on the weekend?</em>
    </p>

    <p>After hundreds of hours of meditation, I discovered for myself that people do pretty much everything to be busy,
        even if it means arguing for fun. Their mind craves presence. Most don’t give their mind presence and try to
        distract themselves.
    </p>

    <p>Do you see how everything is trying to distract you? Do you see how distractions rob your energy? Do you see the
        value of your attention? Do you know what you need to let go of? Do you see how to reignite your flame?
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.6. Hyperreality: Fine-tuned misalignment </strong></p>

    <p>It seems the world is fine-tuned to steal your energy. Everything wants you to give up on life, and everything is
        designed to keep you down.
    </p>

    <p>What’s actually real? Most photos and words lie. Most jobs don’t add value. Most books don’t teach. Most friends
        don’t encourage. Most leaders don’t lead. Most clocks don’t tell time.
    </p>

    <p>Are named days real? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday…? The universe is not built with seven days of the week. If it
        was, I imagine there to be a magnificent sunset every Sunday. It’s easy to forget that weekends are a metaphor.
        They don’t actually exist; they are made up. But you’ve heard about the weekend so often that now it’s become a
        part of reality. Hence, we can call weekends a hyperreality. I categorically hate all hyperrealities. I hate
        weekends, I hate hobbies, I hate movies. Weekends - that’s when all of the peasants leave their houses and
        interrupt my silence. My days, they all look exactly the same. I do not believe in named days. For that matter,
        named days are one of many illusions trying to instill complacency.
    </p>

    <p>Here's another example. Music and alcohol are the only forces able to make spending time with idiots enjoyable.
        That means music has the power to turn off thinking. Who are people who can’t think? Slaves. Even the most
        mundane moment can feel special with music’s help. Most people have a music addiction – and they do exactly
        nothing about it. Some go a step further and wear headphones everywhere. The problem with listening to music is
        that it makes your life feel good when it shouldn’t; happiness must be earned. The same applies to alcohol,
        sweets, and other stimuli; they provoke artificial happiness and are deeply ingrained into society. Let’s <a
            href="blog_3.html">focus</a>
        on music. Where is most music listened to? In the car. Where do most people take their car? To their job. Do you
        see how that fake pleasure makes people complacent? Let’s think further. I think music is a psychological
        weapon. Most songs inject narratives that don’t add purpose to your life. Even if you don’t analyze the lyrics,
        your mind still absorbs their energy. Do you think an earworm of ‘shake your ass’ will bring you closer to
        abundance, wealth, and enlightenment? Why is there music everywhere nowadays? Think about it.
    </p>

    <p>It genuinely puzzles me how some people live ‘happy’ lives and don’t even exercise. When I didn’t exercise, I was
        depressed. … Every German’s favorite phrase is ‘Sport is Mord,’ literally meaning ‘sports kill.’ Do you think
        this is a societally encouraged weakness?
    </p>

    <p>Have you ever tried to eat oats with water, pure cottage cheese, or an onion with a piece of bread? For the
        longest period of my life, I couldn’t eat food. It was too boring. Isn’t that madness that I'm being called the
        mad one for eating bread with onions? I find it pathetic that most foods aren’t actually foods nowadays. No
        wonder everyone is so sick, apathetic, and tired. I want to point out another fallacy. In Germany, people go to
        the bakery in the morning. How can that be real? Eating carbs kills creativity. Why do they do that first thing
        in the morning? Dear heavens. It’s hopeless.
    </p>

    <p>Those were just a few examples. I would argue that everything about modern life makes you content with it. Now
        you don’t need friends, now you can just go online. Now you don’t need adventure. Just play a video game. Now
        you don’t need purpose. Just listen to some music. Well, what about balance? To hell with balance! I don’t have
        technology stripping my will to live!
    </p>

    <p>Balance, the way most people see it, is another hyperreality. They will use balance to hide their monumental
        laziness and disguise that as a goal. If people can’t get something, they pretend to never have wanted it.
        Couldn’t break free from your social media addiction? Well, you need balance! Two hours of mindless
        doom-scrolling a day is okay, don’t be so extreme! Why? Who says balancing your job with an addiction adds
        harmony to the universe? You need to balance your balance – that’s the golden middle.
    </p>

    <p>How do you escape this artificial nonsense? It’s simple. Stop indulging in warm water, movies, sweets, and music,
        and see how your will to live returns. I don’t mean this as an ideal; I mean, actually, do it. Go and stare at
        the ceiling for a few hours. That’s the truth. That’s how you overcome complacency. By removing fake comfort,
        you awaken your soul.
    </p>

    <p>It’s pretty hard to be complacent when you’re stripped of comfort.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.7. The cope you’ve been sold as the truth</strong></p>

    <p>I’ve been interested in spirituality for a very long time. The problem is that spirituality offers comfort. For
        most people, spirituality is cope. They don’t want to follow strict religious laws, so they say they are
        spiritual. They don’t like the real world, so they try to create alternative truths. To hide their lazy
        cowardice, they delude themselves into thinking that God has some plan for them. Guess what. God may have a
        plan, but most are too much of a coward to execute it. Most people are so busy trying to find meaning in nothing
        instead of finding meaning in something.
    </p>

    <p>Meditation is nice, and so is praying. But when you start to think that it’s better to never have been because
        pain outweighs pleasure and some other nonsense, you need to wake up! Why would you want to give up on life in
        search of some nirvana?
    </p>

    <p>So, do not overdo the spiritual affairs. Don't mess up the orders. First, master the material. Then, master the
        spiritual. What the hell do you need spirituality for as a 16-year-old?
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.8. The gratitude drug</strong></p>

    <p>For over a year now, I’ve trained myself to look at the things I'm grateful for. The problem is that this
        gratitude numbed me; it made me happy. Again, why push hard when you can instead appreciate what you already
        have? Why go to work when you can be grateful for the warm bed and soft pillow? For change to occur, you need
        pain, not joy.
    </p>

    <p>Don’t get me wrong. Gratitude is necessary to be alive; not being grateful can even lead to suicide. Not being
        grateful for anything is a certain way to live a miserable life. Please never hesitate to express gratitude.
        Enjoy the blink of an eye called life.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Be grateful, but don’t stop wanting more. Look at the things you want. Look at the things that you want
            to improve. Look at the level you want to get to. Do this, while being grateful for what you have.
        </strong></p>

    <p>In the morning, I look at what needs to be completed, improved, or developed. In the evening, I look at what I'm
        grateful for. You can train yourself to look for problems just as you can train yourself to feel gratitude. I
        realized that one can be both grateful and hungry – no matter how successful. Looking at problems brings your
        mind to work.
    </p>

    <h1>5. Time to be exceptional </h1>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.1. A cute little test</strong></p>

    <p>Here’s is the stoic concept of eternal return. Imagine that if you died, you would forget everything and be
        instantly reborn as yourself. So, you would your exact life an infinite number of times. Nothing would be
        different, every time, you make the same choices. You wouldn’t know your life repeats. Does this idea scare or
        excite you? It’s a test.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.2. Always moving</strong></p>

    <p>Humans have an innate drive to constantly pursue new goals. Once a goal is achieved, it quickly fades in
        significance, and we're eager for the next one – “That’s it?” After overcoming challenges, we enjoy a brief
        moment of peace before seeking the next objective. We enjoy the second of perfect stillness when the sun shines
        for the last time in the year, illuminating the golden leaves dancing in the mildly warm air. I will finish this
        text and feel bliss for a second – and I will be ready for the next thing. This is life. We aren’t supposed to
        stop. </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.3. A million in the bank</strong></p>

    <p>What's the highest pleasure in life? Is it that of a purpose finding completion… Well, one of the highest
        pleasures is sitting with your boys at a campfire. That’s the best thing; it always will be. The difference is
        which stories you’re going to have. Let me tell you, if you live a life, sitting at a campfire with your boys is
        ten times more fun.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.4. The flame</strong></p>

    <p>If you’re content with an average life, truly happy with your “home sweet home,” then you’ve made it. But many
        have a burning desire to progress—a flame inside them. If you can act on it, success makes life beautiful. If
        not, unfulfilled potential leads to a dark existence. Most try to extinguish this flame, fearing the risk. But I
        believe it’s your duty to strive for more, to avoid a life of regret. If you try and fail, at least you’ll find
        peace knowing you gave it your all. Initially, I thought I changed and matured - like everyone wanted me to.
        After this little reflection, I realized I was wrong. I won't extinguish my flame. I’m making it brighter.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong></strong></p>

    <h1>Summary.</h1>

    <p>Pretty much the only reason you’re complacent is because of technology, it robs your desire.
    </p>

    <p>Complacency has three allies: distractions, lesser pleasures, and comfort. These enemies are strong, unbelievably
        strong. But so are their enemies: purpose and desire. To rediscover purpose and unlock desire, one ought to cut
        out comfort, lesser pleasures, and distractions.
    </p>

    <p>I want to share the method I use to recalibrate my desires and combat complacency. For two days, deprive yourself
        of all distractions and pleasures—no <a href="blog_13.html">music</a>, no warm water, no reading, nothing. I
        want you to stare at your
        wall. Once you learn to go without pleasure, complacency will be no enemy. Learn to be bored. Stillness adds
        clarity. Clarity adds <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Most won’t dare to put this text into practice. Are you ready? You already know what to do.
