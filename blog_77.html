  <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">A strong mind doesn't have weak thoughts </span></h1>

  <h1>Cure your mind</h1>

  <p>Your mind creates and follows your every move.<br> Therefore, mastering it is of utmost importance.
  </p>

  <p>Before we get started, what’s good mental health? A mind that aligns with your goals.</p>

  <p>You will first learn why your mind is based on the environment, how to fix your environment, how to fix yourself,
    and how to advance further. Your mind is the only thing in the world you can gain complete control over. You don't
    want to have the darkest thoughts in your most intimate moment. I will condense my mental health journey using
    practical things you can do. I’m excited to share my wisdom.</p>

  <p>The key to mastering your mind is belief. Stop believing you aren't in control. Take radical responsibility and
    fight. Stop giving power to your past. Your thoughts may be against you at this very moment, trying to say that it
    doesn't work. It works.</p>

  <p>Don’t forget—it’s okay to be human. It’s alright to fear, be stressed, and grieve sometimes. It’s normal to feel
    emotions, and life is expected to struggle. Stop expecting life to be easy and stop prioritizing happiness. You can
    feel something and add, ‘And that’s okay.’ </p>

  <p>Are you ready?</p>

  <h1>1. You are part of the universe</h1>

  <p>I want to start this text philosophically because everything will make more sense. On a fundamental level, life is
    molecules doing something; there’s action and reaction. Emergence is another fundamental phenomenon. Directionless
    atoms somehow add up to become galaxies and civilizations. No one fully understands how emergence works; many view
    it as a testament to the existence of a greater power.
  </p>

  <p>The universe's laws affect everyone; you are a part of the universe. The only thing that separates humans from
    being molecules doing something is consciousness. What does consciousness do? It gives you the ability to choose
    what’s right and wrong. Nonetheless, consciousness itself is an emergent property; there’s no clear boundary to it;
    and your consciousness goes beyond your body. Your notebook and the people around you extend your consciousness.
    Your body, nervous system, and thoughts are shaped and extended by the environment. That’s why losing an object can
    physically hurt. – Because you are part of the universe.
  </p>

  <p>The mind is a tool derived from consciousness’s desire to make sense of the world.
  </p>

  <p>Because you are a part of the universe, a healthy mind comes down to a healthy environment. Use brute force to
    remove objects and subjects that extend negative aspects of your mind. - Remove negative friends, social media,
    unhealthy food, and other things you know deep down are harming you. Look at your input. If you consume sexual
    music, eat unhealthily, and get hostile thoughts from social media, of course, your output, here mental health, will
    be horrible!
  </p>

  <p> Life is an energy exchange. You must be careful about who or what gets your energy or which energies you want to
    absorb. Some people or objects bring negative and weak energy; they should be removed.
  </p>

  <p> The universe operates on harmony, and disharmony is at the root of all problems. Identify areas of disharmony in
    your life and focus on improving them. The greatest disharmonies often stem from the misalignment between thought
    and action, imagination and reality, and consumption and creation. Restore harmony by acting more, dreaming less and
    creating more.
  </p>

  <h1>2. Beauty and your environment</h1>

  <p>We have now established that you are inseparable from the universe. - Changing your environment changes your
    thoughts.
  </p>

  <p>What happens to your mental health if you are surrounded by perpetual, never-ending ugliness? Cities generally
    affect the mind negatively; humans are not designed for these hectic and cramped environments. Cities are hotter,
    louder, dirtier, more dangerous, and degenerate; there’s no reason to settle there if you want to prioritize health,
    which you should. Eventually, you should move to a lovely village.
  </p>

  <p>It's interesting how beauty impacts physical health. Hospitals with lovely designs help people heal faster. You can
    see this effect everywhere; thoughtful design magnifies the impact; eyes are a gate to the soul.
  </p>

  <p>A messy room… You can already think of the rest. People will go to monumental lengths to mask their laziness.
  </p>

  <p>Pretty things are often expensive. Are they worth it? Yes. Genuine beauty is among the most valuable resources;
    outstanding quality pays herculean dividends. I never regretted buying something marvelous.
  </p>

  <p>Please remember to delete pointless photos to declutter your mind and memories. Photos link to memories; you don’t
    want to retain specific memories. Cleaning your photos liberates.
  </p>

  <p>Beauty also applies to you. You need to dress well and take care of your body. Your beauty is a reflection of your
    lifestyle and health. Thus, being ugly is impossible if you always spend time outside, eat healthy, sit upright, and
    do sports. Moreover, what you wear and how you make your hair can also impact you; with a suit, you work better.
    Improving your appearance is vital to improve mental health. You won’t feel as insecure if you always dress well.
    You will automatically smile more, and people will respect you more, thus igniting a positive feedback loop.
    Sometimes, life is as simple as brushing your teeth and making your hair. – Still, do not misunderstand me; I used
    to be bald a decade ago, and nothing has changed. Your appearance has an impact, but your competence, status, and
    speech matter much more.
  </p>

  <p>Nature is an <a href="blog_107.html">essential</a> source of beauty. As discussed previously, your mind isn’t built
    to thrive in street art,
    trash, concrete, asphalt, and noise. Your mind is designed to enjoy seeing a reflection in a puddle, the leaves
    moving in the wind, or the sun setting. Deep meditation in nature remains one of the most beautiful experiences.
  </p>

  <p>Let me tell you a little story. Two years ago, when I started creating cinematic videos, I began to view the world
    differently. I had conditioned myself to look at beauty where no one else saw it. When the sky was grey, I saw the
    one golden spot. Yesterday, I was in a castle with stone walls. I instantly saw a tiny purple flower; everyone else
    only saw rocks. I had chosen my reality to include beauty.
  </p>

  <h1>3. Health – diet, sports and sleep</h1>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(1) Diet</strong></p>

  <p>You cannot underestimate the power of a diet. I meticulously observed the effects of foods on my body. I was
    surprised when it turned out that eating cake established negative thoughts. I felt sad and fatigued whenever I ate
    inflammatory foods such as noodles, bread, cake, or pizza. You may not be as sensitive to inflammatory foods, but
    your gut is still linked much closer to your mood than you realize.
  </p>

  <p>If you eat ‘inverted sugar syrup,’ whatever that means, good luck with your health. Food nowadays consists of
    substances that you have never heard of. The definition of ultra-processed foods is food that is derived from
    organic and synthetic components – that means using chemicals that aren’t edible. With such a diet, it’s no wonder
    everyone is slow, anxious, and depressed. Let me tell you a secret. You will get ‘super-human’ energy levels if you
    eliminate all processed foods. You won’t feel brain fog and tiredness. While everyone else can busy themselves with
    having fun and suffer poor mental health, your diet can give you a competitive edge.
  </p>

  <p>I’m in <a href="blog_81.html">Turkey</a> right now, it’s October 2023, and I see six-year-old boys with tits.
    That’s not the way it’s supposed
    to be! What kind of parent lets a six-year-old get that fat? I understand if an eighty-year-old gets a bit chubby,
    but seeing every third child severely obese is bizarre. Truthfully, they may have diseases, but where do these
    diseases come from? - From a poor diet. They are rich enough to stay in a five-star hotel yet don’t eat real food.
    These children are effectively set up for mental health issues for their entire lives.
  </p>

  <p>Your energy levels, emotions, and thoughts depend on the diet, but it goes further. A robust immune system, also
    known as health, improves mental health. How can you elevate your immune capabilities? Nutrition.
  </p>

  <p> Diet is input. If input sucks, output sucks too.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(2) Environment</strong></p>

  <p>Your environment may release toxic chemicals. Clothes, plastic bottles, or other synthetic components impact
    emotions and thoughts. For example, I get a headache from synthetic clothes, which impairs my high-level
    decision-making. Sitting in a car is inherently unpleasant. The plastics get hot in the sun, and you inhale toxic
    fumes. I don’t care about ‘the data,’ but I have observed that excessive radio waves and strong magnets make me
    nauseous. Furthermore, air and water pollution have a significant impact. You automatically feel more anxious if
    your immune system constantly fights toxic air and particles that get into your lungs. It’s all interconnected.
  </p>

  <p>I want you to do a few things.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Gift your synthetic clothes to your siblings. No, I don’t care about excuses. I’m objectively in the top 95%
      when it comes to running, and I use cotton, fur, or wool.
    </li>
    <li> Replace plastic with glass, metal, or wood.
    </li>
    <li> Avoid sweating on plastic objects.
    </li>
    <li> Put your phone away from your body when you sleep and go to places.
    </li>
    <li> Put your wallet in a bag.
    </li>
    <li> If you have enough money, install a water filter.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(3) Sleep</strong></p>

  <p>I don’t know anything about sleep, but I also don’t have any problems with it because I'm not a social media addict
    anymore. Years ago, I used to watch videos until midnight, and now I go to bed at eight because I have taken control
    of my life. I don’t have a bed routine, and I work until the second I close my eyes, which includes looking at
    screens. I go to bed and wake up. I don’t dramatize sleep.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(4) Sports</strong></p>

  <p>We have discussed how appearance can matter. Guess what matters more than appearance? Physicality. The way you
    carry yourself plays a huge role. When I go somewhere, people tilt their heads to me. They feel that there’s
    something about me. Physicality comes down to muscle, size, body language, precisely straight posture, and
    consciousness – people can feel who you are. They can feel whether you quit because ‘you can’t do sports after
    eating’ or whether you’re the kind of person who is heartbroken and starts to run, runs 10 km in 39 minutes on day
    five, fails to move his legs after 6 km on days six, and then refuses to leave his room until ten videos were
    recorded on day seven. That happened in April 2024. Your aurora can be enhanced using sports. A good aurora protects
    you from evil spirits and weak energies, thus improving your mental health.
  </p>

  <p>Physical and mental health are intertwined; fixing one will elevate the other. Diet will also boost physical
    performance. You need confidence and fitness to function correctly. Train hard, and your mental health will see
    wonders. A strong mind doesn’t have weak thoughts.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br></p>

  <p>Here’s a general tip. Never make decisions when exhausted, ill, defeated, hungry, or in emotional turmoil. </p>

  <h1>4. People </h1>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(1) My social skills journey as of July 2024. </strong></p>

  <p>When I came to Germany, I was a lonely kid. After all, I didn’t speak German. In the years prior, I wasn’t too
    integrated in kindergarten, either. So, I was bullied for a while. Later, I learned to assert myself, and these
    problems were gone. However, I still had very little in common with the masses. While everyone else collected
    football cards, I was interested in nuclear physics.
  </p>

  <p>I feel ashamed about something I did in secondary school. I was the bully. I was eleven at the time. I have changed
    since then, and we have moved on. My friends weren’t real friends, so my social skills didn’t exist.
  </p>

  <p> Deeply traumatized from abuse, being bullied, bullying, homelessness, the death of close relatives, being without
    a father, and many other things, I didn’t particularly speak to anyone. Because of C****, my social skills weren’t
    developed either.
  </p>

  <p> After two years of self-improvement, in December 2022, I began to break free from social media addiction and
    stopped using warm water. That’s also when I started to open up for the first time and considered improving my
    social skills.
  </p>

  <p> A few months later, I was somewhat motivated to develop social skills because I had developed a crush. I read ‘How
    to Win Friends and Influence People’ and immediately employed its timeless principles. I started thinking of
    compliments for people I cared about. I also started taking the initiative in groups.
  </p>

  <p> Around the time this text was initially released, October 2023, I became weak due to heartbreak and the failure of
    the apps I had worked on for years. My weakness and loss of discipline made me compatible with some people; they
    became my friends. I even started to go to parties. It was also when multiple teachers told me I had become a
    legend, especially among the younger classes. I remember one time in early 2024 when some 6th graders approached me
    and said they wanted to be unemployed losers, and I responded by doing pushups and explaining that life isn’t about
    being a loser. Creating photos and videos that everyone liked also elevated my status. I had brought myself to the
    point where I could call out people for being weak and teachers for being wrong. I had absolute freedom of speech; I
    could make any joke.
  </p>

  <p> However, towards the end of 12th grade, in the spring of 2024, I outgrew most of my friends. They would talk, and
    I consistently failed to integrate myself because our thoughts kept diverging. It’s very difficult to describe that.
  </p>

  <p> Nonetheless, after I had sat at home for two months because school was over, it was time for prom. It was clear
    what person I had become. “We must dance.” – the girl who rejected me precisely a year ago before prom agreed. I
    danced horribly. Around twenty people I’d never seen congratulated me for getting a perfect high school diploma at
    16. I did not only get known in my school but also in the schools around me.
  </p>

  <p> With that status, touching warm water and not sitting with a curvy back is impossible. Yes, for your mental
    health, sitting upright is extremely important.
  </p>

  <p>After prom and the graduation ceremony, I demonstrated something with the name of perspicacity. - I got invited to
    my state’s celebration for people with perfect high school diplomas. I concluded there must be a high concentration
    of decent, intelligent, and hot blondes. I printed a few business cards with my phone number, videos, and website. I
    got a suit, a white one. I started to rewrite my texts and rebrand. Because I was heartbroken for a year and
    remembered what that felt like, I made sure to talk to as many girls as possible. I gave away a few cards but only
    managed to speak to one blonde.
  </p>

  <p> Now, I'm sitting in a half-lotus position in the middle of nowhere. A group of teenagers passed by with their
    bikes. One of them then started to ask the others whether they knew who they had just seen, and they began to talk
    about an insane guy who had skipped a grade and was active in the realm of business.
  </p>

  <p>In short, I went from having no social skills and a negative status to being able to talk to hot women in only a
    year. That’s what self-improvement is for, and I also thanked everyone, even the girl who rejected me.
  </p>

  <p>When you have high status, people who support you, and a hot blonde who loves you passionately, it’s impossible to
    have negative thoughts. People reflect on who they think you are. Providing evidence for my indomitable spirit made
    people expect only that from me.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(2) They are not your friends</strong></p>

  <p>Most people don’t have your best interest at heart, especially if you surpass them on every conceivable metric. You
    can eliminate the weak energies and live in peace using high standards. Using high standards, you also eliminate
    most of your relationship problems. No matter whether they are romantic, business, or friends.
  </p>

  <p>Most things in life aren’t real. How can your friends be friends if they don’t even know your story? Just because
    you spend time together and talk doesn’t mean you’re friends. Please understand the difference between a true friend
    and someone nice to talk to.
  </p>

  <p>Be a high-quality person to attract high-quality friends.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(3) Life satisfaction </strong></p>

  <p>The quality of your relationships is the key indicator of life satisfaction. The woman you pick is the most
    important decision in your life. You have to nurture your true friends. Caring about other people makes your
    problems go away. Never hesitating to give, always making peace, and telling the truth leaves a pure conscience. How
    about you write to your mother to tell her you love her?</p>

  <h1>5. Fix your priorities</h1>

  <p><em><strong>The answer to life’s inherent discomfort</strong></em> is not comfort but the relentless pursuit of
    excellence. Be fast. Be
    inseparable from your words. Give your best. Live by the deepest realization. Don’t be scared of <a
      href="blog_39.html">high standards</a>. Go
    the extra mile. Dance as if no one is watching, sing as if no one is listening, and write as if no one is reading. A
    strong mind doesn’t get weak thoughts. Taking radical responsibility is the way forward in life. By taking control
    of your mind, you gain control over your life. If you live by these timeless principles, there will be no place for
    negativity because emotions are feedback.
  </p>

  <p><em><strong>Emotions are feedback.</strong></em> Listen to that feedback, and use this energy. Insecurities show
    you precisely what you need
    to improve and why. Listen to them. I did something cowardly; my mind bullies me until I fix that, and I listen to
    that feedback. Feeling depressed? If I was a coward, didn’t clean my room, and didn’t eat healthily, I would feel
    depressed. If you do the brave thing, your mind rewards you with positive thoughts and emotions. Feeling anxious? –
    Deal with your <a href="blog_5.html">procrastination</a>. Your mind is a problem-finding machine. It’s your task to
    solve these problems.
  </p>

  <p><em><strong>Flow and presence.</strong></em> Do the work that brings you into a flow. Writing brings me into a
    flow, so I do that for one or
    two hours daily. The mind craves presence and focus. Understanding this idea will help you overcome cravings, and
    your mind will cease to invent problems out of nothing.
  </p>

  <p><em><strong>Purpose.</strong></em> After having phenomenal mental health, I’m now in a declining phase because my
    apps have failed. That was
    my purpose for three years, and it gave me strength. Regardless of this massive setback, I’m still moving forward by
    writing. - A strong vision and a monumental goal are necessary because the mind likes to be busy. Your current goal
    isn't the final one, but that's okay. Don’t try to find the final goal immediately; it’s better to get moving.
  </p>

  <p><em><strong>Identity crisis.</strong></em> Many mental health problems for adolescents come from an identity shift.
    For example, I’m
    confused about what to believe. I’m currently in a Turkish five-star hotel, and everyone around me is fat. By
    ordinary standards, they are ‘successful’; in my philosophy, they aren’t. Frankly, I’m only 16 years old and don’t
    know which way of thinking will win. I hope that I stay strong and true.
  </p>

  <p><em><strong>Self-image.</strong></em> I’m not someone who struggles with social media addiction. I’ve been on
    self-improvement for three
    years, and therefore, I have mastered my time. Believing that you’re a social media addict will make breaking free
    much more difficult. With a monk identity, social media doesn’t even cross one’s mind. I identify as a fighter, and
    I say, ‘Uncompromising excellence is a true testament to the indomitability of my spirit.’
  </p>

  <h1>6. Using frames to think productively</h1>

  <p> Why are frames powerful? Because they show the brain how to make sense of something. If something doesn’t make
    sense, it will stay in one’s mind until it makes sense, and that’s unhealthy.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(1) Stop assigning labels</strong></p>

  <p>Many people like to label themselves. “I’m a morning person,” “I’m a cat person,” “I’m not a cat person,” or “I’m a
    victim of my traumas.”
  </p>

  <p>The problem with labels is that they are self-fulfilling prophecies, just like an identity. Unless your label is
    inherently positive, avoid them. For instance, don’t say, “I'm a morning person,” instead, “I tend to get up in the
    morning.”
  </p>

  <p>Sticking a label on something makes it ten times more intense. Labeling yourself as a victim will change how you
    view the world, and that is an unproductive lens.
  </p>

  <p>“I'm a person who likes to reflect” can be a harmful label as well because many mental health problems are caused
    by thinking about oneself too much. “Maybe my ass isn’t hot” is something many girls obsess over, and that makes
    them suffer. Growing up is about realizing that others are more important than oneself and coming to peace with
    one’s imperfections. Why not adopt this way of thinking today?
  </p>

  <p>To go truly above and beyond, I want to share another tip: Never confuse good with normal. When you start to think
    that working all your waking hours is good, you will eventually fall back to your “normal,” which can be via
    burnout. When you start to view working all day hours as normal, your mind will be at peace. Don’t label ‘life’ with
    ‘difficult,’ life is the way it is and that’s okay.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(2) How to get over it</strong></p>

  <p>Accepting your emotions means saying that they’re okay. This ends any mental loops you may have and calms you down.
    Getting over something starts by reframing it.
  </p>

  <p>“I can’t stop thinking about her; it hurts terribly.” – “I am thinking about her right now; it hurts, and that’s
    okay.”
  </p>

  <p>“I terribly regret that thing.” – “I’m thinking about my past. I learned my lessons, and it makes me anxious, and
    that’s okay. Time will heal wounds.”
  </p>

  <p>“I can’t stop thinking of the bad times.” – “I’m thinking about my past right now; it makes me feel ill, and that’s
    okay.”
  </p>

  <p>Stop assigning meaning, and don’t create links where none exist.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(3) I don’t believe in burnout</strong></p>

  <p>Burnout isn't real. I could say that I burned out in June 2023 after working up to 14-hours a day for nine hundred
    days in
    a row. But I could also say that I needed a break from working for nine hundred days; I needed time to process every
    failure, and heartbreak also felt bad at the moment. Both ways are factually correct, yet the first strikes like an
    arrow while the second tells you what to do. If you strip apart your issues, you will realize what to do and retake
    power. That’s what it means not to use labels.
  </p>

  <p>Depression isn’t real, either. If you don’t see the sun, don’t do sports, and are asocial, depression will occur.
    That means depression emerges when all of these factors overlap, which means that depression itself doesn’t exist.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(4) Emotions are entirely subjective</strong></p>

  <p>A monk can live happily with nothing; why can’t you? Because you chose not to. Some people die from exhaustion
    after working for nine hundred days straight, for up to 14-hours a day. I didn’t because I don’t believe in stress.
    Emotions are, by
    definition, subjective. I chose to frame stress as feeling useful. In ten years, you will think that you are dealing
    with trivial problems today. In ten years, your perspective will change. Hence, getting emotional about your current
    problems doesn't make sense. It doesn’t even make sense to call them problems; I would instead call them stepping
    stones. Some of your issues aren’t problems but realities of life, for example, rejection. If you don’t obsess over
    opening up your emotions, mental health, and stress reduction, you will live a calmer and happier life. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(5) Use that energy</strong></p>

  <p>I like to believe you get a certain amount of emotional energy daily. How you interpret this emotional energy is up
    to you. Either you interpret it as heartbreak or as motivation to do sports. I once had many deep traumas, and I
    moved on. I didn’t tell anyone anything, and neither did I have any therapy. I simply replaced my traumas with a
    crush. I reinterpreted that emotional energy. That was in April 2023. As of July 2024, my traumas never reappeared,
    even after the crush faded. I had overcome them once and for all. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> (6) Affirmations</strong></p>

  <p>When I say, “What I say is the gospel,” people conclude I'm a narcissist. What they don't understand is that every
    spoken word is energy. Every word is self-manipulation. Saying “I'm strong” and believing it will make you train
    harder. Why, then, should you demolish your energy? Why direct your words to contradict your will?</p>

  <p>Uncompromising excellence is a true testament to the indomitability of my spirit.
  </p>

  <p><em>Psychology? I dare you to analyze me. No matter which perspective or fancy theory, I defy insurmountable odds
      and demonstrate mastery over the mind. I purify my thoughts and attain control over my emotions. Thus, I only
      believe in things that serve me and give energy to what matters. Believing in things gives them power, and showing
      attention expenses energy. For I don't believe in failure; I establish the certainty of success. I understand the

  <h1>7. On handling specific problems</h1>

  <p><em>This section was added a year after this text’s initial publication. </em></p>

  <h2>a) On traumas</h2>

  <p>First of all, what's a trauma? The exact medical definition doesn’t matter because it doesn’t tell you what to do.
    I define trauma as a lesson that one has difficulty getting over.
  </p>

  <p>That’s the feeling you get after losing a close relative, moving to a different country, not having a father,
    getting bullied at school, getting emotionally abused at home, being homeless, being hospitalized right before
    Christmas due to stress, being a bully yourself and growing up with two siblings in a single parent household.
  </p>

  <p>There are few heresies when it comes to negative thoughts. Many people believe that negative thoughts are normal,
    good, and necessary. Furthermore, many also believe that traumas are almost permanent and can’t be fixed easily.
    Most agree that you need a support system, therapy, medication, or you need to open up at least.
  </p>

  <p>Let me tell you the truth. I fixed my traumas without opening up, without telling anyone anything, without therapy,
    medication, or anything else. I convinced myself that I was above the masses who needed help. I didn’t want to be a
    slave to my mind. I dared to contradict everyone, and I had done the impossible.
  </p>

  <p>I’ve forgotten that negative thoughts were a thing. I do not want to fool you; this miracle took months of
    preparation. In December of 2020, I got on self-improvement, which meant working 14-hour days. I had nothing else to
    do. Back then, I desired
    a software business. In December of 2022, I started with real self-improvement because I had gained basic competence
    in what I did. I had time to meditate, do sports, shower cold, journal, and do all of that fancy stuff. That’s also
    the first time I started to talk to people after three years of isolation. From that time on, I began to remove
    every single bad habit; for example, I also started to get rid of my digital addiction. After a few months, in March
    2023, I started making my hair because I developed a crush on a girl. You see, I brute forced everything and fixed
    my life and mental health. I acted as though my traumas were powerless. One night in April 2023, I imagined my crush
    asking me why I was the way I was. So, I summarized my life. The next day, I woke up with a fever, and my mind was
    clear.
  </p>

  <p>That’s what it feels like to be a name, not a number. I took radical responsibility for my life, fixed every area,
    and then my mental health caught up. The mind likes to be busy, and I occupied it with work and a crush rather than
    some trauma. After that “ritual,” I was free.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Real misconceptions about traumas</strong></p>

  <p><em><strong>Traumas make us stronger.</strong></em> Generally, traumas lower physical and mental health. Even
    overcoming trauma leaves trails. But there’s some truth to that statement. If you overcome your pain, you grow.
    Growth attracts success. If you are used to hardship, putting in the work and sacrificing the rest becomes much
    easier. Traumas also provide a powerful self-narrative, where one can view their pain as part of their hero’s
    journey. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Overcompensation.</strong></em> Many think I overcompensate. I don’t believe in overcompensation. I
    want to become successful because being average is boring. Most try to hide their monumental laziness by labeling
    ambition as sick. Am I not right?</p>

  <h2>b) On rejection and heartbreak </h2>

  <p>Rejection, heartbreak, unrequited love, loss, and failure all feel similar because they instill a sense of
    uncertainty and fear for the future. We will primarily <a href="blog_3.html">focus</a> on rejection.
  </p>

  <p>You can employ multiple frames to overcome these problems. However, I want to set false expectations; the key to
    handling these emotions is to fail often, get rejected, and be heartbroken many times until you realize that you're
    still alive at the end of the day.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(1) What to do about rejection</strong></p>

  <p>a) Unhealthy and ineffective, but easy.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Read books and refuse to kill hope.</em></strong> Maybe you should romanticize your struggle… Aren’t
    there
    infinite stories that teach us never to lose hope and never to give up? Perhaps you are indeed the exception?
  </p>

  <p><strong><em> Numb yourself.</em></strong> Try staying a loser, go to parties, drink alcohol, and so on. Ignore your
    thoughts
    and let the future take care of everything. Cope by thinking that time will heal wounds.
  </p>

  <p><strong><em>Drop standards.</em></strong> Abandon your ideals and values. Compromise. Grow up. Be realistic. Accept
    that
    life is quiet desperation, disappointment after disappointment.
  </p>

  <p>b) Neutral but takes practice.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Employ mental frames.</em></strong> It’s nothing personal; no one has ill intentions… You could be the
    most
    beautiful rose and some people simply like tulips. Sometimes, not caring about the rejection is the best thing you
    can do. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> You helped them make decisions.
    </li>
    <li> They know something you don’t; they are currently not in the right position.
    </li>
    <li> No one has bad intentions; it’s not personal.
    </li>
    <li> Rejections aren’t problems; they are parts of life.
    </li>
    <li> In a hundred years, everyone will be dead anyway. What matters is what you do; you won’t regret trying and
      doing your best.
    </li>
    <li> Heartbreak? Some people have genuine pain; a bomb killed their entire family, and now they have to struggle on
      their own.
    </li>
    <li> Get used to it. Realize that you’re still alive after a rejection. You will also be alive after one hundred
      rejections.
    </li>
    <li> God wants you to learn a lesson, get stronger, or test your worthiness.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><em>Reflect.</em></strong> Pointless thoughts tend to disappear if you write them down. Write until you
    cannot
    anymore. Sometimes, you have to let out the negativity.</p>

  <p>c) Productive but takes character.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Try again.</em></strong> For three years, I worked on my first entrepreneurial project, my apps.
    Imagine if I
    quit after one ad campaign. What would you think? I only quit pursuing apps after four campaigns, ad posters, and
    seventy videos. The evidence became apparent. Why do most hesitate to apply perseverance to everyday life? - Fight
    for her heart. How is she supposed to know you’re serious? For your sanity, you have to try multiple times. You
    don’t want to live a life in regret – regret is for mental health. I asked out a girl four times, and that left me
    absolutely free of regret. Another example. After I emailed a CEO to issue me a certificate after I completed an
    internship, and he didn’t respond, I wrote another email. Turns out, he was simply busy. Every single person above
    the age of forty has learned this lesson. You cannot lose if you do not quit, and you must tell people what you
    want. </p>

  <p><strong><em>Become a legend.</em></strong> If trying again doesn’t work, take rejection personally. Let it crush
    your ego,
    and let the rejection change you for the better, forever. Make the rejection dramatic, chew on it for months, and
    feel the pain. Use that energy to live like you have never done before. Get revenge by outcompeting everyone. Use
    every rejection to redefine cutting-edge.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(2) Speedrun letting go</strong></p>

  <p><em><strong>Lie in bed as if you were sick.</strong></em> Firstly, no parties or degenerate friends to cope with
    your loss. You don’t want to absorb their weakness. I recommend a very hardcore method. Lie in bed as if you were
    sick with brutal discipline. If you cut out chocolate, <a href="blog_13.html">music</a>, internet, … and give your
    mind to process things, you
    can recover almost entirely in as little as two days. Two days of isolation and deep rest are better than suffering
    for months. I’ve used this resting without pleasure many times; I used it to overcome heavy failure and loss, and I
    also recovered from <a href="blog_19.html">burnout</a> employing these principles. </p>

  <p>I want to repeat: Unrequited love, a breakup, monumental failure—they all feel the same. The effects are the same:
    you start obsessing over your supposedly ruined future. Also, to clarify, traumas are an obsession over the
    distressing past, while this framework works for the future instead.</p>

  <p>(1) <em><strong>Rest in bed for a day</strong></em> or two without any pleasure or stimulation. Give your mind to
    rest and recover.
  </p>

  <p>(2) <em><strong>Learning and being busy help</strong></em> because they implant new thoughts. If you go through a
    loss, you may notice brain
    fog for a few days. If you repetitively think of a person and it pleases you, your brain automates these thoughts by
    rewiring. By learning new things, you establish new thoughts and wirings.
  </p>

  <p>(3) <em><strong>Employ mental frames.</strong></em> Accept that what's redundant won't happen. Accept that it's
    gone and that everything was
    a test. View it as destiny having made a decision. Life is a test.
  </p>

  <p>(4) <em><strong>Break links using meditation.</strong></em> I started associating going for walks with the girl who
    rejected me. Thus, walks
    drained me. Thus, I began to view walks as meditation. Whenever I would go for walks, I would take a deep breath
    whenever I thought of her. After four hours of meditation, I stopped thinking of her. I fortified my mind by
    refusing to let thoughts enter my mind.
  </p>

  <p>(5) <em><strong>Harmony in the universe.</strong></em> Depression forces you to lie in bed with nothing going on,
    so lying in bed for a day
    voluntarily gives the power back to you.
  </p>

  <p>(6) <em><strong>Close chapters and cut ties.</strong></em> Thank the girl who rejected you; I did that, too. After
    I stopped working on my
    apps' files, I also moved them to a disk. When I finished school, I wrote a letter of gratitude to a teacher. Such
    is the essence of a purposeful life.
  </p>

  <p>(7) <em><strong>Allow yourself to be weak, and don’t try to rush things.</strong></em> Accept it by saying, ‘And
    that’s okay.’ The final thing you can do is take out a piece of paper and write until you run out of thoughts and
    wake up in tranquility. – thus demonstrating mental fortitude, for your resilience to know no bounds, for change to
    be your ally, time your greatest advantage.
  </p>

  <p>(8)<em><strong>Busy yourself.</strong></em> Do sports and read if you don’t know what to do.
  </p>

  <h2>c) On monumental failure and loss</h2>

  <p>Get up. – This is the deepest realization.</p>

  <h2>d) Greatness and its despair</h2>

  <p><em>“By all means marry; if you get a good wife, you'll become happy; if you get a bad one, you'll become a
      philosopher.” – Socrates </em></p>

  <p>Many great souls, such as philosophers or artists, lived miserable lives. However, some of them made their names
    immortal, which stands out. However, if given the choice, no one would pick these lives. There are a few key domains
    to life: work, community, spirituality, and love. If you lack one, then you have to compensate the other areas by
    magnitudes, which is on the border of impossible. Even if you compensate, you cannot hide that life feels
    incomplete. Why should one work without a family needing money? Furthermore, their mind works differently than that
    of the ordinary person. They are extraordinarily conscious of change; they can look decades or centuries into the
    future. That brings endless anxiety and precisely zero pleasure. The human spirit can only derive pain from the
    future, not pleasure. But they can’t stop thinking about the future because that’s the purpose of a creative genius,
    and that pain brings them fulfillment. – You don’t want to dwell in your despair.</p>

  <h2>e) How taking notes changed my life</h2>

  <p><em><strong>How to take notes.</strong></em> Taking notes on a phone is harmful to your mind. Writing on a computer
    is suboptimal because thoughts need to enter the physical realm to leave your mind. However, writing on a computer
    is faster in terms of words per minute, and that’s why I use it. Nonetheless, I recommend you to use a pencil and a
    notebook. A pen feels too official, in my opinion, especially if you write intimate reflections.</p>

  <p><strong>What notebooks to have? </strong></p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Progress tracker.</strong></em> Starting in April 2023, my progress tracker transformed my life by
    holding me accountable, increasing motivation, easing tasks, creating deadlines, and boosting confidence. Writing
    everything down made me more confident and credible, helping me eliminate bad habits and complete small tasks. I log
    the date, day, weather, achievements, events, lessons, deadlines, and future goals.
    <strong><em><br> Gratitude and personal journal.</strong></em> This is the notebook you can open up to. To balance
    negativity, add gratitude. That will massively improve your quality of life, and it will be even better if you pray.
    <strong><em><br>Idea notebook.</strong></em> I used this kind of notebook to store texts, algorithms, plans, ideas,
    and creative thoughts before switching to a computer for readability. It’s sterile and contains only sharable
    content, which I acknowledge should change.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What to know</strong></p>

  <p><strong><em>Default item.</strong></em> Your current default items may include your phone, wallet, keys, glasses,
    and a bottle of water. Those are things you grab without thinking about them. However, if you replace your phone
    with a notebook, you will enhance the quality of your life and look more fashionable. A notebook is a good item for
    extending one’s consciousness. </p>

  <p><strong><em>Don't limit yourself. </strong></em> The most important tip while taking notes is never to restrict
    yourself in the thinking process. If there is an “annoying thought that won't work out anyway” in your mind, write
    it down, no matter how silly it seems. Taking notes purifies your thoughts. </p>
  <p></p>

  <h2>f) When life feels explicitly meaningless</h2>

  <p>The answer is surprisingly simple. You’re too sexual. That’s four-fifths of the problem. If you touch yourself,
    watch highly erotic content, or have casual sex, you will feel dirty while being stripped of desire and energy. If
    you’re a woman reading and you dress with your belly button visible, go to parties, and have male friends - that’s
    the reason why you don’t find purpose in life. Sexual desire is by far the largest desire one can have. Most of your
    mental health depends on how disciplined you handle your <a href="blog_33.html">desire</a>. Creating sublime beauty
    is only possible with the
    inspiration of a woman or with endless discipline. Pleasure kills meaning.</p>

  <h1>8. On gratitude and the fundamental pain of a godless life</h1>

  <p>One may be sitting in a little café atop a mountain and looking at the sea. One may have it all and still be
    unhappy. Others may validate you, but you may feel inauthentic. You implemented every best practice, aligned your
    mind to your goals, removed traumas, gained a vibrant social life, and always put in passion. Now you’re sitting
    with the woman you authentically love and have it all. The waiter brings your order, and you cannot hide something
    deeply unsettling. You cannot hide the pain of a godless life.
  </p>

  <p>After a few deep breaths, something unexpected happened. The world lights up in color. You feel as awake as if you
    had been asleep your whole life prior. Consciousness strikes from above, and everything starts to feel vivid. You
    realize what's real and what isn't. You have reached the deepest realization. – God.
  </p>

  <p>You will also learn that gratitude is the key to fulfillment, not cynicism. Praying or writing down things you are
    grateful for cultivates positive thoughts. You need faith; you need God in your life.
  </p>

  <p> Gratitude is sexy; people who attribute their success to luck are perceived to be more trustworthy. People who
    write letters of gratitude and make peace become legends. Take a notebook and write twenty random things you are
    grateful for. Gratitude reminds you that you aren’t alone, reducing the impact of your negative thoughts. By
    creating presence and positive thoughts, gratitude is joyous itself.
  </p>

  <p> Uncertain, regret, and fear will lose their power with God's presence. Without God, purpose is something
    psychological and, therefore, has no objective reason to exist. I believe genuine purpose exists, and its deepest
    core is God.
  </p>

  <h1>9. Spirituality</h1>

  <p><em>Perched atop a mountain amidst the resilient trees, the tenacious grasses, and the unyielding stones, I was
      filled with a profound sense of peace. The beauty of nature, a testament to the struggle, pain, and dedication it
      took to get there, was a source of inspiration. The grandeur of millennia unfolded before me. The distant towns,
      sleepy villages, and close forests grew and shrunk. Monumental towers rose and collapsed. Mountains folded and
      eroded. The clouds flowed tirelessly, each movement a part of nature's grand symphony. The grass, like a ballet,
      glided through the wind. The trees, like warriors, stood firm, and the stones, like ancient fortresses, were
      unyielding. The eternal cycles of life were a tangible <a href="blog_70.html">presence</a>, a living, breathing
      entity at one's fingertips.
      The moment was a masterpiece of deep peace and near-ecstatic silence. I stood and breathed deeply and meditated on
      the universe's forces while appreciating their eternal sublime magnificence. Amongst the trees, I felt at peace. -
      Why struggle when life is peaceful? Struggle creates beauty. There will be an unparalleled moment beyond pain and
      pleasure where one sees nothing but beauty all around.</em></p>
