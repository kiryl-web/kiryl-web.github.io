    <h1>Kiryl P.</h1>

    <p>If my life were to be summarized in a single sentence, what would it be?</p>

    <p><em>Uncompromising excellence<br> is a true testament to the indomitability<br>of my spirit.</em></p>

    <p>Yet, for some time, I've felt a distance between my ideals and my actions. I failed to embody my own ideals. I
      stopped demonstrating uncompromising excellence. Hence, I decided to put my blog offline for an uncertain amount
      of time.</p>

    <p>If you're still interested in exploring my previous thoughts, you can find them <a href="text.html">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for your understanding, and I hope to share more with you in the future.</p>

    <p>I need to take a deep breath.</p>
