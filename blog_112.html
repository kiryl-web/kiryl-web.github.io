    <h1>It's your fault</h1>

    <p>I'm no mediocre person, and I don't know why I'm explicitly mentioning it. Perhaps it's just as simple as an
        introduction to reach a flow and perhaps it also sets the tone for this text. Normally, people want to portray
        them better by claiming that no one helped them or believed in them. yet, no one ever doubted that I'm out of
        the ordinary - whether you call it crazy, weird, or genius. So, saying that you are special stems from
        insecurity, but still, there are a few qualities that make me truly separate from the rest - I never blame
        anyone for anything. I only blame myself, I'm responsible for my life and that's liberty.</p>

    <p><em><strong>You see what you like.</strong></em> Every idiot can justify himself, because after something happens
        reality molds into the obvious and self-explanatory. Often, things seem to become clear after they are completed
        and the events contradicting this remaining reality get ignored and eventually become entirely forgotten. If
        something fails, that's because one ignored the fragile cracks forming beneath the carpet and something succeeds
        if one made progress despite the cracks. Any idiot can admit to being wrong and it takes even less intelligence
        to be proud of a victory. Everyone can and will point to the cracks of someone, but everyone is blind to view
        his own. Everyone tries to defend themselves; everyone has a corrupted perspective. The word bias doesn't make
        sense, as everyone possesses one. Hence, it's no challenge to complain about the past, yet almost impossible to
        look into the future, since reality is built in a way, where ninety-five percent of it is a projection of the
        mind - you see and hear what you want to and discard the rest. There is 'evidence' for anything you want to be
        true. You only pay attention to what you find exciting and filter out the rest, often without noticing. You will
        think, that you know better because admitting being wrong puts you in an awkward position and sometimes the
        position of knowing better comes at the very end. </p>

    <p><em><strong>It's time to grow up.</strong></em> A lot of people try to ignore their limited perspective and match
        the energy of a young child. This child knows nothing about anything and blames others as its only defense
        mechanism to establish the continuation of sweet passivity expressed by being unknowledgeable. - It's easy to be
        immature. - There is no blame without responsibility and no responsibility without intent if the individual
        claims to be without knowledge. Children are evil because they know that blaming others will bring them comfort,
        pointing fingers never finds consequences, but rather rewards. Precisely this behavior can be observed in adults
        who never learned what responsibility means and instead obsess over comfort. These people claim to be wise by
        pointing to the prettiness of the carpet they bury their weaknesses. The more opulent and magnificent the carped
        looks the more sophisticated the lies become that can be buried beneath it. So, some people try to hide their
        responsibility by pointing to the opulence of the carpet, how can it be wrong if the carpet radiates nobility?
        How can an inexperienced child be blamed for pointing fingers? </p>

    <p><em><strong>I don't need to cope. </strong></em> It does not make sense to assume the fault to lie in the hands
        of someone else. What does that bring to you except comfort and a simple way to cope? It's nice to get your
        mother to hug you after you felt insulted from the fight you provoked with someone stronger. It's nice to feel
        the comfort of a mother, her warm hug, and her delicate soft voice. It's easy to list the ten thousand reasons
        not to be where you wanted to be. Obviously - no I mean - doubtlessly it's the fault of someone else. After all,
        otherwise, your mother would be telling you otherwise and how can she be wrong if she wants the best for you?
        Perhaps you no longer cry in your mother's arms and instead get so-called friends to cope with the emptiness of
        your existence and your lack of inner strength. How can one reject modern comforts, and come to terms with
        'reality'? <em>“You live in the 21st century and comfort is alright; it does not make sense to contradict every
            standard, you only lose by doing so. Phones are a good thing; the truth is just a product of time and
            ever-changing. There can't be such a thing as a coherent human nature, you can't even compare the people
            from the current to the last generation. Go and live life like a normal person”</em> - Yet, I find it
        unacceptable to follow the crowd, which rarely serves me. I refuse to compare myself to anyone as I would not be
        able to live, I don't know anyone who has control of their mind and their life. I do not <a
            href="blog_33.html">desire</a> people's
        demonstration of comfort's embracement; I don't need to see people who are on their phones just to feel superior
        again or to feel content with the pragmatic lack of my discipline. You are fundamentally alone when you play
        this game. There will be no one on your side because they don't want anyone to elevate themselves who came from
        the same circumstances, people like excuses and ways to cope. No one wants you to break free, no one wants you
        to embrace responsibility, they want a hug from their mothers rather than a slap from reality, telling them to
        wake up. Yet, being awake is what makes us human, in the bible, the story starts with humans rejecting sweet
        passive comfortable paradise and gaining consciousness, they more or less symbolically <a
            href="blog_13.html">sacrifice</a> every pleasure
        just to feel what it's like to be awake, to take responsibility. Eve gives Adam the fruit from the tree of
        knowledge from God and Evil rather than the passive tree of life, the latter continues paradise, and the former
        pushes responsibility to the self. You don't need the comfort that derives from sweet ignorance, you need
        responsibility. Telling lies is easy, comfort is easy, and pointing fingers is even easier. — Only when you
        start to embrace responsibility will things change, change starts with you and you only. The truth, it always
        comes out. Sometimes it is suppressed and surfaces only after centuries, yet eventually it does. The longer it
        is suppressed, the more detonating the impact is going to be. It does not make sense to try to suppress the
        truth. You lie to yourself more than you do to anyone else and that's what's making you despise yourself. Are
        you willing to stop lying to yourself?</p>

    <p><em><strong>Failures kill — death by a thousand small cuts.</strong></em> Every catastrophe is difficult to see -
        you see what you want to see and are often presented with contradictory evidence. Most of the time, one decision
        never makes a difference. It's a thousand small sawings that cut the tree to collapse. When the marriage fails,
        it's not because of one silly comment, but instead of ten thousand instances of disrespect. It's never the case
        that a man suddenly becomes abusive, it's because other people let it happen. No one is random enough to cross
        barriers for no reason, every time the reaction is tested and the behavior adjusted, rather frequently it
        spirals down, while other times the other force reacts too strongly. It's never a single drop of water that
        brings a dam to break, but rather the trillions that came before it. Most people would try to defend people who
        seemingly are worse off than them. I know many losers and I know that all of them are indulging in instant
        gratification, no matter which day of the time you are reading this text. Every day you get to choose whether
        you want to be a winner or a loser, a slave or a master. Every time, those people choose to waste their time.
        You might be tempted to argue that they just don't know any different. Well, I used to be a collection of bad
        habits just like them and broke free, and it was not a lot more complicated than taking responsibility and
        stopping blaming others. Every second of the day they decide to e.g. read or to waste time. If their parents
        dragged them down, you can rightfully say that their parents didn't embrace radical responsibility and let
        everyone down, they view their children as a tool to cope with the meaningless life they have constructed
        themselves. Reading is free and so is wasting your time, at least in the moment. Later, not reading is going to
        become expensive, and wasting your time will be so expensive that 'unpayable' can't express it to its full
        extent. Despite this, blaming their parents will not bring them anywhere either, their lives are only going
        better if they wake up, accept and act i.e. take responsibility. Otherwise, they deserve every negative thought
        and hit of destiny, they deserve to suffer because they've done nothing about it and kept blaming others. Now,
        if they deserve what happens to them, someone may point to a meaningless motorbike accident, thinking that this
        will disprove the whole argumentation. But isn't it the case that this person chose to make a fatal turn, by
        being on the wrong point at the wrong time? This person did have the choice to walk or not to. Then, is it the
        fault of a person to be born in Africa? No, but they still decide how they are going to live their life, aren't
        there many successful and free individuals in Africa? Trying to point fingers in this situation does not help
        either. You must accept and adjust, by taking action, taking responsibility, and not by complaining. Life is
        unfair, but who are you to blame for being such? If you blame others, you deserve everything negative that
        happens to you. </p>

    <p>Perhaps I sounded as if I'm a cruel individual, full of spite of my own life, despite mastering everything I
        touch. Maybe. Perhaps sometimes it's nice to be comforted and to let your heart be melted. Perhaps sometimes
        empathy is vital, despite it being illogical. Yet, what I do is that a death by a thousand small cuts is much
        crueler than just standing up from the torture rack and refusing to remain passive, by embracing radical
        responsibility. Be butchered by the lies you keep telling yourself and others or stand up. Every time something
        good happens - thank God. Every time something bad happens - thank God for the lesson and stand up. You are
        free, as you've been given free will by God, and rejecting that offer is a sin. It's a sin to lie to yourself.
