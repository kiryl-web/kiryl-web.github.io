    <h1>Golden insecurities</h1>

    <p>When I was without purpose, goal, or <a href="blog_33.html">desire</a>, I constantly had thoughts that are
        unthinkable now. I used to think
        that everyone hated me, that I was awkward, that I was not trying hard enough, that I was a failure, that time
        was running out, and that the future was coming with great <a href="blog_66.html">uncertainty</a>. I used to
        have dark thoughts and
        insecurities before going to bed and when waking up.</p>

    <p>After three years of self-improvement, I forgot that insecurities were a thing.</p>

    <p>Insecurities are intimate time capsules. They reveal details you don’t want to confront. At each stage in life,
        something else will bother you. The mind is always busy looking for problems, and insecurities tell you exactly
        where you need to improve and why. Insecurities are the best possible mentors. They keep you accountable,
        permanently, for free, until you improve. Endless motivation – that’s their purpose. Enjoy your insecurities
        because you may never have them again.</p>

    <p>Just as with most things in life, insecurities are double-edged swords. Hence, they are neither good nor bad.
        Some show genuine problems. Others are unfounded, mere illusions of the mind. They rob life quality and make
        one's mind work against oneself. For example, many men worry about their height. Why is that a pointless
        insecurity? Because you can’t change it. </p>

    <p>Productive insecurities, or what I like to call 'golden insecurities ', are the catalysts for growth and
        responsibility. They fade away when you start giving your best – the <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a> is
        fulfilled. When you strive for
        excellence, all negativity evaporates.</p>

    <p>Unproductive insecurities may stay no matter how hard you try. They constrain your impact on the world, as they
        provoke no growth and are centered around things you can’t or shouldn’t change. They disappear as soon as
        mastery over one’s mind is attained. How? Via meditation, challenges, and sports. Get to know yourself. Next to
        mastering your mind, here’s another tip. Surround yourself with uplifting individuals. It's hard to be insecure
        when you have supportive people around you. Change your environment to change your thoughts. Fortify your mind –
        your mind a castle – decide what’s allowed to enter your thoughts and what isn’t. </p>

    <p>Listen to the insecurities you know are correct, to the golden ones.<br> Disregard the rest.
