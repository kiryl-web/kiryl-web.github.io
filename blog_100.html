    </h1>

    <h1>Dear Mother,</h1>

    <p>To your 39th birthday, summer 2023.
    </p>

    <p>Imagine every moment you have lived, whether right or wrong, now distant memories, their mistakes forgiven and
        forgotten—for I see none. The two pictures I gifted you embody the passage of time and life's beautiful
        incompleteness. One frame is white, the other black, symbolizing yang and yin. The white frame holds an image of
        a red flower on a white background, exuding elegance. The white represents purity and innocence, while the red
        flower signifies all the sacrifices you made for us, especially for me. The other picture, encased in a black
        frame, represents the future’s unknown journey and the uncertainties it holds. But I promise, the hardest days
        are behind you. May you embrace the second half of your vibrant, fascinating life with the same zest as the
        yellow flower it depicts. Together, these pictures, frames, and colors form a magical trinity, as enchanting as
        your existence, each element completing the other.
    </p>

    <p>I find nothing to dislike about you, as you constantly strive to improve. Your willingness to <a
            href="blog_13.html">sacrifice</a>,
        demonstrated throughout your life, is beyond compare. I could ask for anything, and you would give it, a dream
        for other children. Your unwavering support has shaped my personal development and set me up for success, like
        the programming course in 2021. I cherish my beautiful room and the freedom to explore new experiences. I
        treasure having you as my mother so deeply that it brings tears to my eyes as I write this for the first time in
        2023.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for everything.
    </p>

    <p>This is my 100<sup>th</sup> What a milestone. 147,300 words. Reflecting on my growth, I see how far I've come,
        yet there is so much more to achieve and more battles to fight. This is just the beginning. I am grateful for
        every challenge life presents. I love my life, thanks to you.
