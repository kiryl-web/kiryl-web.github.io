    <h1>Uncertainty</h1>

    <p><strong>Story one. Presence at the moment.</strong></p>

    <p>A few weeks ago, I attended a small business competition. I won first place and walked to the train
        station. I didn’t look at the schedule because I knew there was a train once every two hours. I got lucky; a
        train arrived fifteen minutes after I got there. </p>

    <p>My mother wondered when the train was scheduled to arrive in my hometown. I responded truthfully that I didn’t
        know and cared. I can walk on my own. A schedule won't dictate my life. </p>

    <p>On that train ride, I completed an important task. Six months ago, in February, I started the first ad campaign
        for my app. It failed, and I built up fear as a result. I knew that I had to confront that fear. Thus, I started
        a new campaign on the train.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, my mother looked at the schedule, worrying about me, and she went to the train station to wait for my
        train. Turns out the train arrived thirty minutes late. She waited for nothing while I made the best of my time.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Make the best of any situation.<br>
            Live with absolute inner stillness.
        </em></p>

    <p><strong>Story two. Speed.</strong></p>

    <p>In Russian class, the teacher gave us a worksheet we had to complete. She also explained that next Friday, we
        must make a presentation about our summer holidays with a five-minute target duration.</p>

    <p>I instantly raised my hand, asking if I could give the presentation right now. </p>

    <p>I wanted to skip all that useless nervousness and doubt and do something. I gave the presentation without notes
        or without ever speaking it through and nailed it.<br><small>Friday, 8.9.2023 </small></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em> Waiting is stress. </em></p>

    <p><strong>Story three. Faith.</strong></p>

    <p>Before the presentation from story one started, I went on stage and waited there, visualizing myself winning and
        showing how desiring and ready I was. I gave the first presentation and got first place. Be calm instead and
        fight. <br><small>Friday, 18.8.2023</small></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Fear is holding you back. </em></p>

    <p><strong>Story four. On valuing the journey</strong></p>

    <p>I decided to go to a ruin somewhere in the mountains. I knew the ruin's approximate location, and that was
        enough. After hours of searching, I found it. I didn't know or care where the ruin was located because I knew
        this would cause useless pressure. Instead, I enjoyed the path more than the destination - Eventually, I still
        found the ruin hidden in a mountain's top covered in trees. <br><small>Saturday, 10.9.2023</small></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Path over destination;<br> discover more when you don't look at the results.</em>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em> The person who loves the fight<br> defeats the person who loves to win.
        </em></p>

    <p><strong>Story five. On staying resourceful</strong></p>

    <p>I’m an essentialist. In May 2023, my family and I went on a trip to Vienna. I took my camera gear with me, and
        that’s pretty much it—no food, water,* or any of that fancy stuff. After all, we had breakfast at the hotel. I
        got lucky; there were fountains everywhere. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Be <a href="blog_107.html">essential</a>.</em></p>

    <p>Embraces life’s uncertainty. Obviously, don’t be too silly, and don’t challenge life. Uncertainty brings a seed
        of success. It will take a few years until you realize that worrying, living by someone else's rules,
        hesitating, and overthinking are all illusions. Use these timeless principles to navigate the turbulent waters
        of life.</p>
