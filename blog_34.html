You want all your desires to be fulfilled, with food, sex, luxury, safety, good   weather, and so on. But, as you have read my previous text, “Dreams” you know, that these desires are short-lived, and will get boring soon. But, how do you avoid this world to get boring? There are a few options.">

    <h1>Life is paradise</h1>

    <p><em>I believe you will profit from adopting the belief that life is paradise. When you start to think that life
            is perfect the way it is and embrace reality, it opens the gate to a life where every second matters.</em>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Construct your paradise</strong></p>

    <p>I will begin with a few thought experiments. </p>

    <p>Envision a realm of your creation, a paradise where every desire is fulfilled. A place devoid of troubles, where
        only bliss reigns. Picture a garden teeming with endless sustenance, idyllic weather, awe-inspiring sunsets, and
        every other element that brings you joy. Can you not feel the allure of such a place, the irresistible pull of a
        world where everything is perfect? </p>

    <p>You don’t like classical paradise? No problem. Let’s imagine being on a spaceship to Mars. You are at the
        pinnacle of human achievement, the result of marvelous engineering and a testament to human cooperation. Out of
        the window, you witness a monumental sight: the earth and how it slowly fades away. Regardless of the sight,
        covering billions of kilometers takes some time. How would you pass that time? With reading, video games, and
        <a href="blog_13.html">music</a>. There’s not much to do in a spaceship.
    </p>

    <p>What if you don’t enjoy space too much, either? Imagine you are in a post-apocalyptic bunker with enough food and
        entertainment to cover decades. Would you not be tempted to go outside?</p>

    <p>Still not convinced? Enter the pleasure cube, another philosophical idea. The pleasure cube is a machine where
        your brain gets plugged in to simulate the wildest experiences and eternal bliss. You would never suffer and
        never feel bored again. Would you take this offer?</p>

    <p><strong>All paradises have a problem.</strong></p>

    <p><em>No, you would not choose to live in paradise. <br> A white square is perfect. Yet, it’s boring. </em></p>

    <p>People show little appreciation for free things. They value what’s difficult and painful. Why? Because value and
        meaning stem from pain. If you were gifted everything at will, nothing would provide pleasure anymore. Seeing a
        picture of a mountain is worthless. Perching atop gives meaning to the picture you would take. The journey
        matters more than the destination.</p>

    <p>Reality, with all its imperfections, is more valuable than paradise. No matter how much pleasure can be found,
        meaning stems from hardship. There are no stories to be written in a realm without pain. Because life is full of
        pain, it never gets boring; there’s always something to discover. </p>

    <p>Paradise is undoubtedly lovely for a day. However, immortality in paradise, eternal depravity of meaning, must be
        the most tremendous suffering. Hence, people don't want paradise. Every attempt to construct paradise on earth
        has failed and will fail. If there is no meaning, people will find ways to create it. People will overthrow
        paradise to prove a point. </p>

    <p>Is this text really that philosophical? Do I truly need to explain what it's like to live a life with little
        pain? Most people don’t suffer; they don’t have a purpose, so entertainment remains the only thing left to do.
        They don’t live happy lives. - Without pain, you couldn’t even walk; there’s no reason to. Discipline is
        developed by hardship. You won't get out of bed if hardship is missing in paradise. If you can't get out of bed,
        you suffer, and you know that. Some people find it hard to get out of bed in real life, even though real life is
        far away from paradise. Complacency is pain. You see, the lack of pain causes pain. That’s the harmonious nature
        of the universe. </p>

    <p><em>While others complain they’re suffering, I'm glad I do. Growth is always painful. People who prioritize
            happiness over mastery tend to have the worst lives. Struggle creates beauty. </em></p>

    <p>Here’s a thought that seems to support paradise at first glance. An integral part of human nature is the desire
        for certainty. People enjoy being obedient; they like to have a script for life. Yet, where’s the meaning in
        something already determined? Let’s phrase it differently. Let’s say we were to modify human nature to live in
        paradise, where everything is determined, safe, and pleasurable. Let’s say we were built not to feel pain and to
        never run out of pleasure. Why would that not work? Because there’s no reason to be conscious. There’s no reason
        to be alive in a realm that does not require one’s efforts.</p>

    <p>Life can be a source of tremendous pain, yet it remains the preferable choice. Humans are not designed for
        endless pleasure; there’s something that transcends human <a href="blog_33.html">desire</a> beyond pleasure: the
        love for anything genuine,
        beautiful, and meaningful. Hence, we don’t need a paradise; stop hoping for someone to improve the universe.
        Only reality is good. Life is already perfect the way it is.</p>

    <p><strong>If life is paradise, how should one act?</strong></p>

    <p>There’s an axiom that served me well. The denial of reality is always detrimental. There’s a video game that
        enables players to explore an infinite and exciting world. Players can build systems, develop themselves, build
        things, and explore the world. The player experiences endless freedom. But why should you play when life can be
        your playground? Why read fiction when you can take action in the real world? When making reality your priority,
        you get to live the best conceivable life. It gives meaning to every second. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Embracing reality means writing one’s own story.</em></p>
