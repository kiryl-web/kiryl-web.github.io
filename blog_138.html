    <h1>Chosen by God </h1>

    <p><em>“I congratulate you for your perfect Abitur,”</em> with Abitur being the German name for an ‘elite’ high
        school
        diploma. </p>

    <p><em>“I congratulate you, too; you’ve got an even better graduation paper, but I feel a bit guilty. I did nothing
            for
            it. While some people studied and genuinely gave their best, I didn’t. It’s not like I not only did not
            study, I
            focused on my stuff.”</em>, I responded while remembering that I'm a spiritual teacher in my videos and need
        to
        relax, just like in a cold shower, while talking to the girl I asked out four times. </p>

    <p>Only a tiny percentage gets a perfect high school diploma. Some students cried on that day, and I felt even more
        guilty. Some got their dream crushed. - There I stood with a perfect result, having done absolutely nothing for
        it.
    </p>

    <p>It’s not that I didn’t do anything for school; it’s worse. I didn’t know my grades, and I didn’t study. In the
        school lessons, I wrote texts, read books, programmed, meditated, edited photos, and thought about hot girls. At
        home, I never studied either. I focused on my business, fitness, and meditation. Still, I was blessed. This is
        far from the only example.
    </p>

    <p>It seems God has his favorites.
    </p>

    <p>Winning without trying is not possible without a blessing.
    </p>

    <p>How can it be that some excel at everything they try? Some seem to glide through life like a surfboard on a wave,
        while others constantly get crushed by the waves. Someone may try ten times as hard and still fail.
    </p>

    <p>What does that mean to everyone who tries and still fails? What is even one’s achievement, and which is someone
        else’s? What is the role of radical accountability when God has favorites? Why does God have favorites?
    </p>

    <p>I don’t have the answers.
    </p>

    <p>I may not have the answers, but I can use gratitude to explain that very little is mine. I didn’t choose to be
        born in the 21st century, breathe fresh air, have electricity, and utilize technology to my advantage. I didn’t
        decide to be developed by my parents, which enabled me to sit down for ten hours straight. I didn’t choose to
        have everything aligned the way it did. It was pure luck.
    </p>

    <p>What’s luck, anyway? Luck is when preparation meets opportunity, but what does being a God’s favorite mean, then?
        Seeing more opportunities? Having a greater capacity to prepare? I want you to decide.
    </p>

    <p>Luck can change—it can grow and shrink. Hence, humility and gratitude. I do not take credit; I give credit to
        others. I believe that patience with results and <a href="blog_62.html">speed</a> in execution summon luck. I
        encourage you to use your
        luck to multiply the luck of others.
    </p>

    <p>Life is a test. Everyone has their place in the universe. Failing to use one's luck means failing at life. Your
        luck is pointless if you don’t use it. Most people, unfortunately, don't do anything with their luck. They
        celebrate a bit too much. They give up. They sin. Their luck runs out.
    </p>

    <p>I believe that if one is blessed, one is meant to have an even greater role. There’s a price of being lucky: You
        get a lot more responsibility. With greater capacity comes greater <a href="blog_13.html">sacrifice</a>. Such is
        the way of <a href="blog_52.html">duty</a>.
