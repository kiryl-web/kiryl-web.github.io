    <h1>One thing...</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Introductory example - Why I chose app development.</em></strong> A few years ago, I faced an
        important decision. I had to decide which kind of software I wanted my business to be about. I picked app
        development over web development. Both web and app development offer massive advantages, and both can bring
        cash, reach huge audiences, and provide excellent customer experiences. Since I had experience in neither, I was
        not in the position to make a rational decision. So, how did I end up making this life-changing decision? I
        chose app development because I preferred the feeling of an app over a website. After all, apps are always
        faster by a few milliseconds. So, my life changed forever because I preferred a very tiny detail. The rest is
        history. I learned how to program at 13, and at 15, I had my first online app that put my soul in. As the story
        continues, when I was 16, the commercial success of the app failed, and now I have a story or two. Life is
        unpredictable.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Yes, one detail makes the difference.</em></strong> One insignificant and subjective detail makes the
        difference. One can argue anything and make data show whatever one wants. I could have had an endless argument
        about which software niche to pick, but I just picked and stuck to it. After one has picked, it’s easy to
        justify the decision logically. Almost everything has endless pros and cons; thus, one detail decides. The key
        to sales is identifying which detail one does or doesn’t want to buy. Every house has a quiet location and a
        comfortable layout. Yet, only one has a white blossoming cherry tree.</p>

    <p><strong><em> The moral of the story.</em></strong> Every detail matters; hence, tell and show the truth; a
        blossoming cherry tree might make the difference at the place you least expect. </p>
