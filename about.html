    <h1>Part one. My life philosophy.</h1>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1. The deepest realization</strong></p>

    <p>What is real? Most books don’t teach. Most leaders don’t lead. Most questions don’t need answers. Most
        words are false. Most plans fail. Most desires don’t fulfill. Most feelings don’t require action. Most clocks
        don’t tell time.
    </p>

    <p>If you were to list why something will work and why it won’t, there would be a hundred reasons each. Even with
        perfect information, predictions lack confidence. Yet, sometimes, one reason
        defeats ninety-nine. There’s always a place for miracles.
    </p>

    <p>Therefore, everything is possible; there would be no opportunity if everything were determined. Yet, God has the
        final word. You can master archery, yet no matter your excellence, there will be a time when you miss.
    </p>

    <p>In a world of infinite uncertainty, the only thing worthy of judgment is the purity of one’s heart. Try,
        even if the probable outcome is a failure.
    </p>

    <p>Only by setting sails – passionately and with a smile – can you navigate the turbulent waters of life.
        Giving your best is the antidote to adversity.
    </p>

    <p>Indeed, the world is dangerous. No mother wants to see their child dead in their arms. But you must make a trade:
        are you willing to answer your call to be a hero?</p>

    <p>What would you do if you weren’t scared? What would you do
        if you couldn’t fail? What would you do if no one was watching?
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Life is paradise</strong></p>

    <p>I believe those who show up every day, do the brave thing, and genuinely give their best cannot fail in the
        long run, for life is incredibly giving.
    </p>

    <p>What feels better than love? Who can paint better than your eyes? What is more fulfilling than the
        adventure of your life? What sounds better than water flowing, flames rustling, and the wind whispering?
    </p>

    <p>Everything beautiful has already been created. Therefore, life is paradise – and we want to turn away.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Purpose </strong></p>

    <p>I suffer; therefore, I am. Growth is pain; stagnation is pain; decline is pain. You cannot escape
        suffering. The taste of life is pain, so why not use that energy? I believe in the relentless pursuit of
        excellence. A life without continual growth is unbearably mundane, yet tedious nonetheless.
    </p>

    <p>I enjoy talking to friends about life at the fire. But is a simple life truly enough? Perhaps not. Why not
        learn to appreciate life’s gifts while doing great things? Indeed, happiness comes from within.
    </p>

    <p>Almost every pleasure has diminishing returns; purpose isn’t one of them. My favorite emotion is the way
        golden leaves dance in the year’s last sunshine. Fulfillment is a timeless gift, a paradox, fleeting yet
        permanent.
    </p>

    <p>What’s masculine essence? Direction. Purpose sits at one’s masculine core. I make no compromise: this is
        the only way to live. With a purpose, your world transforms into roads and vehicles, tools and obstacles, allies
        and adversaries.
    </p>

    <p>Most are busy trying to find meaning in nothing. That’s a fallacy. Purpose never disappears, and we only
        need to open our eyes. Find a reason big enough to justify the suffering of your existence. Purpose is the only
        way known to a man able to alleviate all pain.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Being true </strong></p>

    <p>What is the most masculine thing? It’s silence. Are you willing to confront who you are?
    </p>

    <p>I have a reputation for saying exactly what I think. In a few generations, everyone alive today will be
        forgotten. So, why bother saying things one doesn’t believe in, and why pretend to be someone else?
    </p>

    <p>My visions are no joke. I don’t pretend to want less than I do to please others. If someone wants less,
        they can go and find less somewhere different.
    </p>

    <p>I value those who show their true self, for they bring me closer to the universe.
    </p>

    <p>I do bold things with no regret because I am true.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. A successful life</strong></p>

    <p>My spirit is willing, but my flesh is weak. Be it so, for I cannot change the universes’ constantans.
    </p>

    <p>Naked I was born, naked shall I die. Everyone alive is guaranteed death. How you spend the blink of an eye,
        called life, is up to you. Very little matters in the end.
    </p>

    <p>When God thinks, things are – that’s infinite power. Power is the distance between thoughts and their
        manifestation. The narrower the gap, the greater the power. I have long thought of my central goal in life. I
        concluded that a successful life brings the gap between reality and thoughts as close to zero as possible. I
        define a monumental life as one where all obstacles have been overcome, and one’s mind becomes the final
        constraint.
    </p>

    <p>Pursuit shrinks the gap between reality and one’s thoughts – that’s the definition of success.
    </p>

    <p>What is good enough? I don’t know; perhaps I will never, and that’s okay. Having a clue is overrated.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>6. Love</strong></p>

    <p>You have to know precisely what you want or at the very least start searching. Without a goal, there’s no point
        in starting anything.
    </p>

    <p>Most things in life don’t matter. Love isn’t one of them. I will dedicate every lived second to pursuing
        what matters; I will go to monumental lengths for love.
    </p>

    <p>Faith is the light necessary to move through darkness. We are all alone, floating through the cold infinity
        of time and space. So, why not add a bit of warmth?
    </p>

    <p>I believe love is the root of all purpose. I can think of no better fortress than love. Death may be
        inevitable, but that doesn’t mean we can’t love with all our hearts.
    </p>

    <p>What’s an indomitable spirit? One that never gives up, never fatigues, never quits, and always radiates
        passion. That spirit is truly endless – just as love.
    </p>

    <p>Thus, I conclude,
    </p>

    <p><br><em>
            Uncompromising excellence <br>
            is a true testament to the indomitability <br>
            of my spirit.</em>

    <h1>Part two. My story, in short.</h1>

    <p><strong>When I was 2</strong>, I learned that Santa Claus was an illusion, as I recognized my uncle in the
        costume.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 3</strong>, my parents divorced.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 4</strong>, my uncle, who I’ve been close to, died in a motorbike accident.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 5</strong>, we moved to Germany from Belarus.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 6</strong>, I was bullied in school.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 7 and 8</strong>, I lived a happy life.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 9</strong>, my mother and I were emotionally abused by my stepfather. We also lived in the
        homeless shelter for a few weeks.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 10</strong>, I spent a few days in the hospital with shingles; I was released at Christmas.
    </p>

    <p><strong>When I was 11</strong>, I got in trouble for bullying two classmates. That’s the lowest I’ve ever been.
    </p>

    <p><strong>When I was 12</strong>, I lived a pointless life and hated it.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 13</strong>, I started my first business and got on self-improvement.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 14</strong>, I went straight from 8th to 10th grade while working full-time on my business.
    </p>

    <p><strong>When I was 15</strong>, I took a short break from my business, so I created 375 short timelapse and
        slow-motion videos in 60 days. A few months later, I had my first product online, a mental math app. I started
        to feel alive for the first time. I replaced every bad habit with a productive one. For example, I began to do
        150 pushups and 50 pullups a day.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 16</strong>, I moved on from past pain and became social. I published two more mental math
        apps. I lived without warm water, sleeping in, music, or sweets for months. I started my self-improvement
        channel and blog. I solved 10,000 mental math tasks in 11 hours and recorded it because I wanted to promote my
        apps and to have a remarkable story. I asked out the same girl four times and saw a year of heartbreak. I saw
        depression and burnout after my first business failed after 5,000 invested hours. I started focusing on videos,
        creating 50 videos in 90 days. I also finished 12th grade with a perfect high school diploma. I wrote 400,000
        words in 500 days because I was getting up at 3. I ran 10 km in 39 minutes and recorded ten videos in 13 hours
        the next day.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 17</strong>, I was rejected in person 50 times in 4 days. I wanted to cement my resilience.
        Altogether, I recorded 126 self-improvement videos and at 17 years, I lost any desire to continue, making this
        my second failed business. I also got rejected 50 times in 4 days. University started and my health declined
        severly. To gain upward momentum, I ran a marathon and it reset a year's worth of progress. I then decided to
        study two semesters at one, the 2nd and the 6th, which improved my life.</p>

    <p><strong>When I was 18</strong>,...</p>

    <h1>Part three. Why struggle when life is beautiful</h1>

    <p><em>High school graduation day,<br> June 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024</em>
    </p>

    <p>Atop a mountain amidst the resilient trees, the tenacious grasses, and the unyielding stones, I felt at
        peace.
    </p>

    <p>The beauty of nature, a testament to perpetual suffering, inspired me. The grandeur of millennia unfolded before
        me. I could see how mountains folded and eroded, how forests grew and shrank, how towers rose and
        collapsed.
    </p>

    <p>The clouds flowed tirelessly, each movement a part of nature's grand orchestra. The grass, like a ballet, glided
        through the wind. The trees, like warriors, stood firm, and the stones, like ancient fortresses, were
        unyielding.
    </p>

    <p>The eternal cycles of life were a tangible presence, a living, breathing entity at one's fingertips. I saw the
        work of a master – a symphony of tension and release, a moment of completion.
    </p>

    <p>I stood in perfect stillness and breathed deeply. I meditated on the universe's forces while appreciating their
        eternal magnificence.
    </p>

    <p>Amongst the trees, I felt at peace.
    </p>

    <p>Why struggle when life is beautiful? Struggle creates beauty. There is a moment beyond pain and pleasure where
        one sees nothing but beauty all around. You yearn to seize it, yet it remains elusive, a heartbeat suspended in
        time – if it’s the final one, be it so.
