    <h1>Monk mode guide</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <p>Like many, once, I was a slave to my phone, my diet was a mess, and TV was my constant companion. The concept of
        sports was
        foreign to me.</p>

    <p>Over the past three years, I've embarked on a journey of profound transformation. I made a decision to strive for
        monumental success in life, a success that transcends the conventional notions of a house and family. It wasn't
        easy. I had to battle with distractions, bad habits, and the allure of instant gratification. But I persevered,
        and for six months, I lived a life free from anything that could hold me back. Once a mere flicker, my
        discipline has become a blazing fire. </p>

    <h2>2. Motivation</h2>

    <p>Why do we need this text? It's because modern technologies, if not used mindfully, can become addictive time
        killers and distractors. Look at mindless social media consumption. It's a time, attention, health, and
        emotional energy drain for some meaningless entertainment. This constant distraction leaves you with no time to
        pursue anything authentic, and your diluted attention keeps you stagnant in life. The damage bad habits create
        is well-known, yet many try to numb and distract themselves even further. Life becomes a perpetual stress if you
        waste time. After all, “you can’t be productive 24/7 and need to switch off”. But this principle of life:
        adaptation, means that sooner or later, those fun things, such as internet usage, don’t provide the fun they
        used to. Hence, you need more and get even more addicted and look for new pleasures. Such is the life of a
        hedonist. It’s a painful cycle, seemingly filled with joy. It's time to break free from this vicious circle.</p>

    <p style="width: 80%;"><em>Fun things, e.g., the internet distracts you → Waste of time → Stress, caused by the
            waste of time → “Switch off” by distracting yourself from the stress → Eventually distracting yourself is no
            longer enough → You seek new distractions. </em></p>

    <p>There are two core motivators: pleasure and the desire to counter pain. For example, sports are the <a href="blog_33.html">desire</a> for
        health. Getting rich creates pleasure in the form of freedom. Yet, those motivations aren’t too great. The
        motivator to avoid pain is magnitudes more potent. The potential to lose everything makes people defy
        insurmountable odds and work like there’s no tomorrow. </p>

    <p>What about motivation, then? You need pain to change your life. Turning points are always marked with pain. Pain
        is the taste of change. Only if you are miserable will you be willing to change, to abandon what you deem holy.
        – Here’s how I finally broke free from my phone addiction. I estimated that I had wasted seven thousand hours.
        There are eight thousand hours in a year. This realization hurt enough to make me never touch the internet
        again. Indeed, it was a bit more nuanced, but the message remains. The pain was large enough to trigger a
        cascade of change.</p>

    <p><em>If you do not experience the pain necessary to break free, allow a few more years to pass by. You will see
            how many opportunities you missed, how your health deteriorated, how much potential was buried, how many
            days passed without progress, and how often you struggled for nothing. You will realize how many years of
            your life have been wasted, especially those of your youth. Let regret give you motivation. It may be too
            late, but at least you were convinced you had fun. </em></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, it's not enough to decide rationally. If life was just as simple as making a simple decision… If
        you decide without pain, comfort and complacency will get you. Exceptional progress comes from expectational
        pain. Visualizations can, of course, help to magnify pain. Outside of that, there is no shortcut. You may
        understand this text now, but you will truly understand this if a bit of time has passed.</p>

    <h2>3. Start extreme</h2>

    <p>You will be willing to change once your destiny has hit you hard enough. If you haven’t reached this point, save
        this text for later. </p>

    <p>For one week, better for two weeks, you cut out any bad habit at once. You’re not allowed to compromise, not
        under any circumstances. That means you cut out sweets, movies, stimulation, social media, junk food, warm
        water, internet, sugar, and coffee… Yes, coffee is a bad habit for most people. You need to cure your brain.
    </p>

    <p>The most important thing to eliminate is excuses and delays. You don’t need social media for friends, family and
        business. To hell with business; do you even have a product? You don’t need to watch videos. Since the dawn of
        human existence, people survived without social media. Go for a walk. You don’t need to eat sugar; you will
        thrive without it. Stop listening to your brain; it has put you in a terrible place! Start today.</p>

    <p>What does it truly mean to decide? Deciding means carving in stone, then throwing the chisel away. Deciding means
        cutting alternatives. People who can’t make decisions and constantly make excuses are frowned upon. No legend
        attained their status through excuses. </p>

    <p>Your belief system is based on past experiences and aims to predict or manifest the future. Chances are, your
        beliefs are unproductive ones to pool from. The fastest way to change your beliefs is to surround yourself with
        people already possessing productive beliefs. Since the mind can’t differentiate between reality and thoughts,
        there’s an even easier way. Absorb the productive beliefs by reading from great individuals. </p>

    <h2>4. Slip back – the valley of despair</h2>

    <p>After initial progress and motivation, you will notice a decline. Your discipline and willpower were stretched
        far beyond their capacity. Logically, they exhaust. Hence, you will slip back, and that’s natural. Slipping back
        is part of the progress, often even multiple times. Only after many trials can mastery be attained. You can’t
        skip stages, and falling back is a necessary test.</p>

    <p style="width: 90%;">Here's an example. I started showering cold roughly a year ago, and I lasted pretty long for
        the first time; I was full of motivation. The following times, my motivation decreased, and after two months, I
        kind of stopped showering cold. Life is always intertwined. At that time, I also slipped back from my journey to
        removing my digital addiction. Then, I started to regain momentum by showering both warm and cold for the last
        few seconds and using my phone consistently less. Momentum built up with discipline, and now I shower cold only
        and haven’t wasted a second online in months. </p>

    <p>Accepting that slipping back is part of the progress will prevent your mind from bullying you. Things take their
        time.</p>

    <h1>5. Cut out slowly</h1>

    <p>After making massive initial progress and slipping back, it’s time to progress - slowly. Don’t overthink and
        overcomplicate things. Do fewer bad habits because you must remember that every decision is compounded. Whenever
        you are about to make a decision, ask yourself if it brings you forward by a point or backward.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Change your identity.</strong></em> When I say, “I’m the sexiest person in my town of twenty-five
        thousand people,” I mean it. People conclude I'm a narcist. What they don't understand is that every spoken word
        is energy. Every word is self-manipulation. Saying "I'm strong" and believing it will make you train harder.
        Thus, it materializes. Why, then, should you demolish your energy? Why direct your words to contradict your
        will? Viewing myself as the most attractive person makes wasting my time on social media not even cross my mind.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Keep accountability.</strong></em> Find an accountability partner—it could even be your friends or
        family. As of June 2023, I have no one to hold me accountable to; hence, I use my website and notebook. That’s
        good enough since I never lie in my notes. You must become inseparable from your word. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Cute tools.</strong></em> Screen timers or app limits are valid options initially, but they leave
        temptations. To remove temptations, delete your social media accounts. If YouTube or Instagram is necessary for
        you, at least use the PC versions; otherwise, delete them. There is absolutely nothing that you are going to
        miss out on. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Find lower alternatives.</strong></em> Replace videos with podcasts. Replace ultra-process sugars
        with honey and fruits. That will calm your cravings. It happens that podcasts saturate the mind more than short
        videos. Thus, your content addiction disappears. Apples saturate more than gummi bears ever could, yet with less
        sugar.</p>

    <p>With enough consistency, you should approach mastery. Soon, you will see light at the other end of the tunnel and
        gain further motivation. You will be able to look back and conclude that you have improved.</p>

    <h2>6. Perspective</h2>

    <p>While removing bad habits and distractions, you gain a bunch of time. There’s a simple solution—set goals. If you
        don't know what goals to set, boredom helps with creativity. Write down every goal you can think of. These goals
        should be just out of reach to maximize results. </p>

    <p>Read and do sports if you want to fix your life without aiming for massive success. In the right atmosphere,
        reading is pleasurable. Sports nurture both body and mind and harness social energy. If you have too much time,
        why not go on a massive hike? </p>

    <p>I started writing because I had to balance my work with something else. Writing changed my life forever, and you,
        too, will discover new passions. </p>

    <p>Now, there are also new priorities. </p>

    <ul>
        <li><em><strong>Sleep.</strong></em> If you don't sleep well enough, you can't function properly. Most people
            sleep less than they need because they lack discipline. </li>
        <li><em><strong>Sport.</strong></em> If you don't go to the gym because you have a rest day, at least go for a
            walk. I go for a walk every single morning at 5 a.m., even on weekends. I see the sunrise, and it's lovely.
        </li>
        <li><em><strong>Meditation.</strong></em> Similar to sports, meditation lets your mind rest. Meditation adds
            stillness to the mind, which reduces anxiety, awkwardness, and stress and improves tactical thinking.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Reading.</strong></em> Reading keeps your mind young and sharp. Replace grabbing your phone with
            grabbing a book. Without reading, I wouldn't have been able to create such essays. Reading is valuable
            because it opens the door to further knowledge and, eventually, wisdom. Reading will help fill in any
            missing puzzle pieces in this essay and provide details and surprising findings. Knowledge increases your
            impact as a person.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Faith.</strong></em> You cannot live life on your own. Without God, there’s no discipline. </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>7. Being an essentialist</h1>

    <p>I never worried about the appearance of my website. I only focused on writing. </p>

    <p>Only do the important things. Say no as your default answer. Ask yourself why you do something. There are more
        than enough essential things; if you only focus on them, you will live a fantastic life.</p>

    <h2>8. Accelerate</h2>

    <p>Now, let's say you have removed distractions, replaced bad habits with good ones, set goals, and know what to
        work on; now, imagine how your new life will turn out. It’s focus that makes an arrow fly and speed that makes a
        small bullet dangerous. </p>

    <h2>9. Plan with breaks in mind</h2>

    <p>Work hard, play hard. You could live your whole life in this focused mode; a certain caliber of person does.
        They’re called legends. Yet, virtually all people are not built to function that way. Hence, plan to rest and
        have fun. What proportions work and rest you need, or how exhaustion shows to you, I don’t know. Emotional pain
        out of nothing is a sign of you needing a break. </p>

    <h2>10. Final thoughts</h2>

    <p>What do you want to get out of life - is it some meaningless hedonism or progress? Do you want to avoid regret? I
        think this is one of the truest ways to live.</p>

    <p><em>Use motivation to gain momentum. Then, use discipline to <a href="blog_3.html">focus</a> and maintain momentum using it.</em></p>
