    <h1>June 14<sup>th</sup></h1>

    <p><em>This text is a little celebration because I managed to go from having negative status for 10-years to very
            high recognition in just one year.</em></p>

    <p><em>“Tomorrow, many of us will see each other for the last time. Everyone will go their
            own way, and that's a good thing. They say nothing in life is permanent except change. School is now a
            closed chapter, and what remains are sweet memories. I want to thank you very much and say goodbye. I wish
            you all the best.”</em>
    </p>

    <p><em>“Please write a book with positive affirmations one day.”</em></p>

    <p><em>“Thank you very much for the compliment. Here's my favorite affirmation. - <strong>Uncompromising excellence
                is a true testament to the indomitability
                of my spirit.</strong>”</em></p>


    <p>Yesterday, I wrote in the group chat and got 33 heart reactions, the first message to do so. A mere year ago, I
        had zero social skills and now I had finally surpassed everyone in status.</p>

    <p>Today, I saw many of my classmates for the very last time. We had a school report ceremony today. School is a
        closed chapter. Am I sad? No. Do I have regrets? No. Do I fear the future? No. Everything that happened did so
        for a reason. </p>

    <p>This text is me looking back on 11 years of school. It’s not 12 years because I skipped 9th grade.</p>

    <p>The best place to start is at the beginning. School wasn’t always fun; in fact, for the first ten years, until
        the end of 11th grade, it was horrible. In primary school, I got bullied, and years later, I was the bully.
        That’s no fun and I’m not proud of it. I had a negative status for a very long time. I despised everyone;
        everyone disliked me. I had a severely damaged personality, and my life was horrible.
    </p>

    <p>At age 13, I was fed up with being a failure. At 15, in December 2022, I started to be social. Plenty of the ice
        in my soul had melted. Yet, the school still sucked; I had no social skills, and I still had many toxic traits.
        I believe school is only enjoyable with friends, yet back then, I had none.</p>

    <p>In March 2023, at 15 and in 11th grade, I got a crush on a girl. My social skills accelerated because I pressed
        extra hard. For example, I started to think of compliments for each classmate. I got rejected in June and later
        on a second time, third, and fourth time, and it hurt for a year until the end of 12th grade, June 2024. Her
        rejections massively bettered my character, for example, by making me lose my delusional pride and developing
        empathy.</p>


    <p>Jumping back to the beginning of 12th grade, some people slowly started to notice me. After the summer holidays,
        I could feel people noticing how hardcore I had been living. They sensed my energy after three months without
        <a href="blog_13.html">music</a>, sweets, or warm water. I began to gain recognition for various things. For example, my indomitable spirit
        in gym class and extraordinary humor were noted. People also took note of the questions I asked. I also did dips
        and pushups during breaks and lessons. My confidence and authenticity were well-regarded, and so was my
        passionate, fast, and energetic approach to everything I did. Everyone also knew I was among the best students
        of all time. In 12th grade, I had 12 consecutive 1+ grades. Despite working on projects during the lessons, my
        teachers and peers considered me the most attentive and brightest student. - Multiple teachers told the younger
        grades that they found me very interesting. Spreading goodwill, expressing gratitude, and giving compliments
        also elevated my status; so did making friends and talking to people. Giving my best by creating cute movies and
        photos also accelerated my status. Slowly, all of these things accumulated, and I can state that I became the
        highest-status student. I didn’t expect, and it only became apparent at prom. Spreading goodwill, putting in the
        work, and being myself paid off.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, I didn’t care much about school itself. I knew my vision did not require learning the quadratic
        equation, so I was indifferent to its lessons. I never did anything for school; I programmed, wrote, meditated,
        or edited photos. I skipped 9th grade because I wanted to get school done faster. That was one of the best
        decisions of my life. I hardly studied and only sometimes completed homework. I didn’t care and focused on my
        stuff. And still, because of my <a href="blog_62.html">speed</a>, I was seen as the brightest and most attentive student in my school.
        That’s why I don’t deserve the perfect high school diploma.</p>

    <p>In short, school sucked for a decade, and I managed to turn everything around. I managed to transition from
        negative status to getting abundant recognition among my peers.</p>

    <p>Today, at the school report ceremony, that became apparent. A year ago, I looked in my diary and concluded that I
        must be the sexiest person in my village. Now, many recognized that to be true, and I came closer to being a
        complete person. During the ceremony, I got many awards, but that’s not all. I managed to be entertaining by
        getting up when my name was called and buttoning my suit when I came to the front. So, now the ceremony had a
        humorous element. Buttoning your suit is almost striptease, am I not right? I was also the only person who ran
        to their mother to give her the flowers I got. I walked with pride. I looked everyone in the eyes. I’m a
        professional. I thanked my teachers, and I thanked my friends. I dared to express confidence, competence, and
        gratitude.
    </p>

    <p>I also thanked this girl who broke my heart for a year straight for accelerating my development. I also told her
        that, ‘In 20 years, I'm a billionaire’—if not a billionaire, then a millionaire. And now that I’ve said it, I
        must do it because I'm not a liar. Now, I have no option but to become massively successful. I have to.
        Sometimes in life, you throw dice, and it has to land at six, no matter the laws of the universe. </p>

    <p><em>“If you stay in the group chat, organizing a reunion in 2044 will be easier. Some people, like me, have
            things to prove, so the reunion is a huge priority. Until then, farewell!” </em>– me in the group chat again
    </p>

    <p>Was school a success for me?<br>
        Was not getting the girl I wanted a success? No.<br>
        Was massive positive character development success? Yes. <br>
    </p>

    <p>School may have been terrible for 10 out of 11 years, but in the end, I went out not only victoriously but at the
        very top. Socially, academically, physically, and spiritually, … Thus I conclude,
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Uncompromising excellence<br>
            is a true testament to the indomitability<br>
            of my spirit.</em>
