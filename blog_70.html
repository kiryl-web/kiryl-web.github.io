    <h1>Desperate awakening</h1>

    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The mind craves presence</strong></p>

    <p>Today, my reality broke apart. I don’t even want to describe which words unmistakably touched my ears and broke
        my heart once more. I knew I would end up documenting this moment. These words struck like an arrow out of
        nowhere and with deadly precision. Saying my reality broke apart in eleven words is an understatement. </p>

    <p>I was fully present again.</p>

    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Mental presence, the middle, and absence</strong></p>

    <p>Shattering pain yields the most brilliant insights. </p>

    <p><em><strong>The three modes and the unstable middle.</strong></em> Your mind can be in three states. </p>

    <ol style="width: 90%;">
        <li>Fully absent, the thinking self is suppressed.</li>
        <li>Fully conscious, similarly to the first, the thinking self is gone and one connects to the universe
            directly.</li>
        <li>Your mind can be in the unstable middle of presence and absence. Things don’t like to be unstable; that’s a
            law of the universe. Hence, your mind tries to achieve total presence, or you have to numb it so it won’t
            annoy you.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em><strong>The undesirable middle.</strong></em> What does being stuck in traffic, standing in a queue, or
        filling out documents have anything to do with presence, mindfulness, and enlightenment? Nothing. Your mind is
        in this strange middle, where you are neither entirely absent nor present. No seasoned individual would argue
        that standing in a queue is fun. Traffic is inherently annoying. Filling out documents is draining. Now, you may
        be wondering why that is. </p>

    <p>Being half-present-half-absent is painful because stress, worries, overthinking, and <a
            href="blog_36.html">insecurities</a> appear. When
        you dream of your vacation while filling out documents, it’s impossible to feel bliss; the delta between reality
        and desire becomes too large. </p>

    <p>A wandering mind is an unhappy one.</p>

    <p><em><strong>How novices deal with the thinking mind. </strong></em> If the voices in one’s head become
        unbearable, your desire too large, and thoughts too negative, one might do something about it. The mind craves
        presence. Do you know how most deal with the annoying mind? </p>

    <p style="width: 90%;"><em><strong>(1) Pleasure. They use addictions, hedonism, and bad habits.</strong></em> They
        turn off the thinking mind instantly. Cheap pleasures kill the perception of time and self. For example, video
        games engage your mind so deeply that you can’t think of anything different. Alcohol turns off the thinking mind
        altogether. The fact that bad habits are habits proves how colossal the desire for presence is. I believe you’re
        an intelligent person, and I don’t elaborate on why numbing your mind using pleasure destroys your potential,
        steals your health, and sells your soul. </p>

    <p style="width: 90%;"><em><strong>(2) Pain. Inventing problems.</strong></em> Some people are above perpetually
        numbing their minds. Hence, they employ other, more sophisticated tactical attacks. For example, some
        procrastinate to add some action and intense emotions. Others fall in love with someone who doesn’t want them.
        Others obsess over their past and get cynical joy from hearing bad news. If the world fails to give purpose,
        they will try to make one up. I am guilty of this at times, too. After a pointless argument, relief feels
        cathartic, rejuvenating, and refreshing; all problems seem to fade.</p>

    <p>But there’s a better solution.</p>

    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The power of the present mind</strong></p>

    <p>Instead of trying to numb the thinking mind with pleasure or filling it with artificial pain, one can embrace
        consciousness, mindfulness, and presence.</p>

    <p>Embracing consciousness is unbelievably powerful. It eliminates imaginary pain and the desire for shallow
        pleasures. Cheap pleasures lose their fun, bad habits lose their grip, and addictions become powerless when one
        gives presence to the mind. </p>

    <p>I call another powerful meditation, ‘life is paradise.’ If you eliminate artificial pain or problems and only
        focus on what’s real and meaningful, you will have no time to worry about low-level issues. You will have no
        time to live in a fantasy world if your real world is filled with action.</p>

    <p>Hence, embracing presence brings peace. </p>

    <p>It is peace that allows you to focus on what truly matters.</p>

    <p>Presence is one of the keys to happiness. There’s something beyond comprehension when the infinite soul unites
        with your finite body. I like viewing the mind as an instance between your body and soul. The thinking mind
        blocks this energy transfer, and as a result, you suffer. Mediation nurtures the connection between the soul and
        body. You will profit from connecting your body and soul more closely. Your soul is indefatigable; it is pure
        direction and energy. </p>

    <p>Reaching mindfulness starts with breathing correctly. Every time you take shallow breaths, you become
        unconscious. You also need to meditate. Meditation brings a deep sense of peace, purpose, and presence. </p>

    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The hurdles to a conscious life.</strong></p>

    <p>How does the bible start? Eve gives up paradise because she wants to be conscious. The <a
            href="blog_33.html">desire</a>
        for presence and consciousness is truly colossal. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Some people can’t be present at all.</strong></em> Some people don’t have a voice in their heads.
        That seems unimaginable, but it’s true, just as some people don’t have souls. You don’t encounter these people
        too often. There’s very little to discuss with a person who doesn’t even have thoughts. They aren’t necessarily
        stupid, either. Some live a goldfish-level existence and still go to university. Unfortunately, these people
        will never be able to experience an absolute, enlightening presence. They don’t even know what ‘mental presence’
        means. If they don’t have an annoying mind in the first place, how are they supposed to experience the authentic
        sublime?</p>

    <p><em><strong>Absence and presence feel similar.</strong></em> At the extremes, presence and absence merge, and
        their boundaries blur. Let me give you an example. During the peak of my burnout in June, I had no random
        thoughts – just as you would after gaining full consciousness. In actuality, I had zero presence. I don’t
        remember anything that happened, and my diary entries are empty. It was as if I never existed, thus solidifying
        my disingenuous perception of presence. You may be confused about why I bring up burnout - because we’re all
        different. What I consider <a href="blog_19.html">burnout</a> is what others live as their norm. For most,
        having a week pass where nothing
        happened is normal. Most grossly overestimate how conscious they are. </p>

    <p><em><strong>The curse of consciousness.</strong></em> Consciousness is a double-edged sword, like most things in
        life. If someone is born with an immense capacity for consciousness and this cannot be fulfilled, this person
        will live a miserable life. If I didn’t do business and write, I wouldn’t have an outlet for my massive
        consciousness. If I tried to live a normal life, I would be miserable deep down. I need the dark, high, and cold
        to feel alive. However, most people don’t find success because there are infinite ways to fail. As a result,
        they live in quiet desperation. No matter how much they try to numb themselves, it doesn’t work. Unfortunately,
        most are forced to do something that doesn’t bring them in a flow. Consciousness magnifies, both pain and
        pleasure.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Reaching what’s beyond grasp.</strong></em> I want to end with something motivational. A decade ago,
        you could have gone into a forest, enjoyed the golden atmosphere created by the low-light angle, and felt at
        peace amongst the trees atop a peak. However, back then, you could hear planes buzzing in the distance. Today,
        the serene blue is quiet. Progress in a long enough time frame makes the impossible come true without anyone
        noticing. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Focus and flow.</strong></em> I don’t believe in work-life balance, and neither do I believe in free
        time. If your work brings you in a flow, you will not want to do anything outside of that. The concepts of flow,
        focus, and presence are quite similar. Hence, focus is critical to a pleasant life. If you focus passionately on
        whatever you do, you will live a fantastic life. Focus determines whether someone lives an invisible or
        monumental existence. Your ability to focus decides whether you spend your life filling out documents or
        conceiving the best move possible. Unfortunately, most things don’t pay; however, finding someone one can give
        it all is a truly beautiful existence. In any case, <a href="blog_3.html">focus</a> is something beautiful.</p>

    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Enlightenment </strong></p>

    <p>Yesterday, I felt a bizarre sensation on an otherwise unspectacular walk. </p>

    <p>From one moment to the next, I felt as if the world went up in color, shedding its monotone façade and revealing
        its true identity. It seemed as if the world wasn’t real and only a reflection of the mind. Suddenly, everything
        felt strange – but at peace. It felt as if my ego had faded away; I felt deeply connected with the universe. I
        had unlocked a spiritual level I couldn’t have conceived of; I never felt as present before. </p>

    <p>Since then, I've had a permanent flow. </p>

    <p>Enlightenment is when you realize that nothing is real except <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a> and your soul;
        you are enlightened when you
        realize that very few things truly matter.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>

    <p>What's the meaning of life? Discovering everything your mind and soul are capable of while reaching
        monumental success.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Live by the deepest realization.</em></p>
