    <h1>Happiest time of my life</h1>

    <p>Three years ago, at 13, I started with self-improvement.
    </p>

    <p>My <a href="blog_50.html">first business</a> was apps, and I worked on that goal for three years. I aligned my
        entire life to that goal.
        However, after five <a href="blog_50.html">ad campaigns</a>, seventy videos, and thousands of hours, I had to
        face the fact that I was
        building a product no one wanted. So, I lost my first <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a>, and I’ve been getting
        weaker ever since.
    </p>

    <p>I enjoyed having a goal to work on, and without one, I'm a shell of what I used to be. I’ve been getting weaker,
        less disciplined, and physically sick. Heartbreak also started to hurt.
    </p>

    <p>So, here’s my attempt to restore my disciplined lifestyle.
    </p>

    <p>From December 1st, 2023, until February 29th, 2024, precisely 90 will pass.
    </p>

    <p>I want to create 50 videos in these 90 days.
    </p>

    <p>Today is November 8th, 2023, and there are 22 days left in November. That means I have some time to prepare.
        Today, I printed a list of which videos I would record. I have 54 blogs that haven’t been created as a video. I
        will discipline myself to hit this goal, which should help me regain strength. If I get exhausted, my second
        goal will be to read the first three bible books.
    </p>

    <p>I believe that as a man, one must constantly redefine what’s possible. Leaning beyond one’s edge is happiness.
        Thus, I think I will look back on this project with deep gratitude.
    </p>

    <p>Ninety focused days can make a lot of work happen.
