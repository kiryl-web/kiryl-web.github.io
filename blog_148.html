    <h1>Why I follow my dreams</h1>


    <p>I stood on a crowded train. It was utterly silent. No one bothered to look at anyone; no one spoke or said words
        that could have started something great.
    </p>

    <p>You could only hear the tracks as the train drove on them, the beeping sounds of the doors, and the speaker’s
        occasional announcements.
    </p>

    <p>Everyone lived their life, and somehow, all our stories were met here.<br>Now, and never again.
    </p>

    <p>Yet, because my fellow passengers were so lifeless, I wondered:<br>Who actually wanted to be there, who was
        building their dream, or who needed a single word of encouragement?
    </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the train arrived, it was time for me to leave and I never found out. </p>
