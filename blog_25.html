    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Life lessons from a vacation</span></h1>

    <h1>Travel educates</h1>

    <p>On the way home from Barcelona to Prague, I reflected in my diary on the life lessons of a two-week vacation with
        my family.</p>

    <p>Before we start, I'd like to express my gratitude for this vacation and thank you for being a loyal reader. I
        never liked vacations, yet this vacation helped to soften the burden of my recent burnout. During this vacation,
        I met new people and improved my social skills. I made a lot of mental progress and learned a lot through
        reading. Novelty also enhanced my <a href="blog_91.html">creativity</a>.</p>

    <p><em>In the end, what remains are the lessons.</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>(1) Things take as long as you want them to take. </strong></em></p>

    <p>Working with a speech professional for a year helped a lot. Nonetheless, my speech could have been better,
        especially on camera. However, I didn’t let this deter me. In March 2023, I started creating self-improvement
        videos, but my severe stuttering required multiple recordings and extensive editing. In July, I recorded two
        videos after my <a href="blog_19.html">burnout</a>. As I edited the second one, I had enough of stuttering. The
        day before the vacation
        started, I made a decision. I would use this opportunity to confront my stuttering. I recorded a 5-minute
        summary of the day without any preparation. After 57 minutes and 2 seconds of practice, my stuttering halved.
        This was a testament to the power of perseverance and <a href="blog_62.html">speed</a> in achieving the most
        unbelievable results. </p>

    <p><em><strong>(2) Learn the easy or hard way. </strong></em></p>

    <p>I knew that you could practice talking in front of the camera. Still, I didn’t start before I got fed up with my
        incompetency. There’s a difference between knowing and understanding things. Understanding demands pain and
        perpetual struggle. </p>

    <p><em><strong>(3) Everyone has their family.</strong></em></p>

    <p>Can Carreres is a village in Catalonia, Spain. It looks lovely in the pictures. I walked through it once and
        never returned there. Why? You see, in Czechia, everyone greets each other. In Germany, every house has a carpet
        or sign with the imprint ‘Welcome, wholeheartedly.’ Many homes don’t have a fence in Germany. This village had a
        different view of things. Every house had an aggressive dog, view barriers and video surveillance. There is no
        welcome sign, just warnings. Some people don’t like others. Now, you would perhaps think that only rich people
        live there. Their houses and cars painted a different picture. The hostile atmosphere was supported as I didn’t
        see a single soul there. – However, I think the people aren’t necessarily unwelcoming. They, like anyone else,
        want to live peaceful lives. They don’t want annoying tourists to run over their land. They have a family and
        want to live in peace.</p>

    <p><em><strong>(4) You need to fight for your identity.</strong></em></p>

    <p>I met a 19-year-old boy. I don’t want my texts to be hurtful, but I don’t know how to describe him like a
        gentleman would, so I won't try. He is a loser on every metric. His body was deformed from being online all day
        long. His social skills stopped developing in kindergarten. He was more submissive than any girl I’ve ever met.
        When I told him to stop being weak and challenged him to run, he gave up after two hundred meters. We were going
        8 km/h. At least he tried. He studied computer science. My mother befriended his mother, and that’s how I got to
        know him. This situation is ironic because my mother first thought I was similar to him. I don’t know whether
        that’s an unintentional insult or not. Secondly, my mother used him as a positive example. Why? Because he
        listened to his mother. I don’t listen to women. Whenever my parents, specifically my mother, want me to do
        something, I fight and think for myself. It’s necessary to go your way and to write your story, especially when
        young. People who do not dare to write their stories get forgotten.</p>

    <p><em><strong>(5) Life every day as if it’s your last.</strong></em></p>

    <p>I never liked water, the beach, or the sea. One may think I should like the beach; after all, seeing young women
        without bras is almost a sublime experience as a teenager. The glances from everyone looking at the physique my
        lifestyle gave me were also nice. Unfortunately, that isn’t very meaningful. You know, young braless
        women are nice, but I would rather work. Water is not my element, and the beach is not my place of excellence.
        So, I swam passionately as if I had done that for the last time. I haven’t touched water since. Put passion into
        everything you do. </p>

    <p><em><strong>(6) Live by the deepest realization</strong></em></p>

    <p>After a day in Barcelona, I was hungry and exhausted. Just like in Vienna, two months previously, I ate
        breakfast, and that’s it. We drove back from Barcelona to our hotel by train, but the train was crowded, and we
        had to stand. The train tracks were parallel to the beach, and the world was in golden light. The moment was
        pleasant but exhausting. Something switched as I drove past village after village. I realized that vacations,
        with all their relaxation, idleness, and abundance, are meaningless existence. I’m not built to function sitting
        in a hotel by the beach. I can’t do it. </p>

    <p><em><strong>(7) Sitting upright does wonders.</strong></em></p>

    <p>Every thirty-year-old complains about back pain, and I don’t want a life of non-unique lessons. I have
        aggressively tried to stand and sit upright for a year now. I refused to give my ‘scoliosis’ power. It worked. I
        cured my posture. Then, I read a book explaining that an erect posture indicates good health and high status.
        There are neural pathways to track status, and body language is an excellent indicator. Naturally, I started to
        pay attention. Spoiler: most people are low-status. I was standing and sitting upright all the time; I got so
        much more attention than in all the previous years combined! There must have been something about my energy that
        was felt. I’ve never seen that women turn around to say “Hola.” </p>

    <p><em><strong>(8) My spirit is indomitable. </strong></em></p>

    <p>Vacations in an all-inclusive hotel tempt. An infinite variety of desserts provoke. You are expected to have fun
        on a vacation. However, I knew what truly mattered. I didn’t touch a single sweet. That proved something
        fundamental to me. You can give me the biggest temptations, and I will become stronger. I’m ready for life. </p>
