    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400">A love story reaching full circle</span></h1>

    <h1>June 9<sup>th</sup></h1>

    <p>I thought about how to start this text for a long time and concluded that the best place to start is the
        beginning. My name is Kiryl P. and I’m currently seventeen years old, I was born in Belarus and moved to Germany
        at five years of age. My life wasn’t easy. Death of a close relative, homelessness in a foreign country, being
        bullied at school, bullying others, emotionally abusive stepfather, growing up to a single mother,
        hospitalization due to stress, ... I've seen it all.
    </p>

    <p>One year had passed and my tramatic chapters ended, I was 13. In December 2020, I started to use that energy,
        trauma, and stress that built up over the past decade to do something. I started to learn how to program as it
        was clear that I would start a business, build an audience, and become a massively successful individual. I
        worked up to 14 hours a day until June 2023, where I could not longer. In the meantime, many things changed. I
        started to meditate, create videos, do sports, and develop social skills. I managed to turn my life around
        successfully. Because I was in pain, which I used as <a href="blog_96.html">motivation</a>, and stress-tolerant
        I was able to live a life
        hard to replicate. </p>

    <p>On June 9th, 2023, I asked out the girl I crushed on and I couldn’t believe getting rejected. In 2023, and I
        state this without arrogance, I was genuinely the most attractive person I knew. I had a story. I knew how
        romantic, passionate, purposeful and dedicated I was. I developed myself at an
        unmatched pace while demonstrating absolute indefatigability. </p>

    <p>But here I was – with all that I have been through, what I’ve done to build myself and the indomitable spirit it
        gave me – suffering from rejection... for a year now. She was able to break me, genuinely, the only spirit
        so far. </p>

    <p>She was one of, if not the most attractive girls I knew, both pretty
        and with excellent grades – that means, I found her legitimately attractive for a very long time. I have
        discussed before why I admired her. Yet, what should I remember her positives for? That won’t make my soul reach
        tranquility. </p>

    <p>As with any love story, it is painted with sadness, disappointment, and pain. I simply couldn’t believe being
        such a fool when she spent time with someone else. Months later, a few things changed and I asked her out again
        because I believed her heart was worth fighting for.<br>
        The sky is starry when you are young.
    </p>

    <p>In March of 2023, I fell in love. In June 2023, I asked her out. In January 2024, I asked her out once more,
        wrote a love and then invited her again. All for nothing. In March 2024 I had to come to terms with that she
        simply did not want me. Such is life. Yet, until recently, my heart was still confused. I had many spikes of
        hope interrupted by the confrontation of reality. And then there was my mind which was always busy looking for
        problems. I understand very well, the heart goes without one’s will - Just as twice two makes four.</p>

    <p>A blink of an eye later, it was June 8th, 2024, prom. Initially, prom was fun. Why? Because everyone knew who I
        was. Parents, grandparents, students from other schools, and other random strangers I’ve never heard of or seen
        knew me by name for some reason. Having been in a position of negative status before, I appreciated what status
        felt like. Status is one of the best things in life. Many congratulated me for getting a perfect Abitur and for
        being 16 years old while finishing 12th grade, and for creating amazing videos. During prom, I demonstrated
        indefatigability, I danced like crazy, which also brought recognition. I want you to guess what's more
        important then status.</p>

    <p>“We must dance together”, I invited her. She agreed, which I'm grateful for - do you see how that will bring
        tranquility? I indeed practiced dancing and somehow, I forgot all of it. I kept my word and danced with her. By
        that point, however, I understood I had never gotten her heart and would never get it. </p>

    <p>As the night progressed, more stars appeared on the night sky, I didn’t find enjoyment. No matter how much status
        I might have had, how much everyone complimented me, how much I drank, how many other girls I danced with, and
        how energetically I danced, I couldn’t plug the whole in my heart. She found someone else and I had not fully
        got over her.</p>

    <p>This is love story exactly one year long and it reached completion.</p>

    <p>Today on June 9th I woke up and it bothers me no more.</p>

    <p><em>Or does it?</em></p>

    <p>This is the end of a chapter in my life. – This is the beginning of a new chapter in my life.</p>

    <p><em>Never did I <a href="blog_80.html">regret</a> letting go.</em></p>

    <p>I'm a gentleman - I must thank her for making me more human. Getting her rejection massively helped me. I
        appreciate the mental and emotional struggle because it gifted resilience to me. I will find the right one, she
        will perhaps too. God himself must have sent her to test me. Now I know much better who I truly am. I don’t know
        what the future is going to bring. I do know that our paths will not cross each other anymore. Yet, change is my
        ally, time my greatest advantage. And I would like to finish with a quote.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Uncompromising excellence<br>
            is a true testament to the indomitability<br>
            of my spirit.</em>
