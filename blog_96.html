    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">The “why” sets free monumental energy</span></h1>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>Some fail at the slightest obstacles.<br>Others can unleash monumental forces.
    </p>

    <p>Most quit the second it gets mildly hard.<br>Some keep pushing and go, ‘Yes, I love it.’
    </p>

    <p>Some get up every day and change nothing. They don't dwell on giving up; they've already given up. They’ve
        forgotten they had dreams and now stay precisely where they are.
    </p>

    <p>Others, with seemingly infinite energy, constantly redefine what’s possible. ‘I cannot give up; I cannot fatigue,
        for my resilience knows no bounds. Every day, I confront life.’
    </p>

    <p>Every lived second matters. I firmly believe that every second is a potential turning point. Every thought,
        action, and belief carries weight. Some choose to stay in bed, while others opt to confront their biggest fears.
    </p>

    <p>Everyone alive is guaranteed death; everyone’s seconds are countable. Some choose to do something with their
        time, while others don’t.
    </p>

    <p>I’m here to share how I keep going when no one is watching.
    </p>

    <h1>1. Deprive yourself of anything</h1>

    <p>Use silence and solitude to determine what matters and what doesn’t. Stop distracting, entertaining, and busying
        yourself; deprive yourself of pleasure. Stillness is needed to find the truth. Give your mind time to process
        everything.
    </p>

    <p>Stare at a wall.
    </p>

    <p>Literally, if you stare at your wall for two hours, you’ll gain clarity and insight.
    </p>

    <p>Reflect on every decision you’ve made. Think of death. Visualize your deathbed. Picture your funeral. Think of
        the decisions that need to be made.
    </p>

    <p><em>What would I do if I weren’t scared? What would I do if I couldn’t fail? What’s the biggest thing holding me
            back? Where do I need to make peace? What’s success? What truth am I avoiding? What makes me feel alive?
            What do I wish I would have done? What if I had one more year to live? What would I do if no one was
            watching?
        </em></p>

    <p>Reflect in solitude to find true motivation.
    </p>

    <p>That’s what rebirth means.
    </p>

    <h1>2. The power of purpose</h1>

    <p><em>“He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” – Nietzsche</em></p>

    <p>Never underestimate the power of the mind.
    </p>

    <p>Let’s say you went through hell and fought every day to survive. Others had already given up because they had
        lost hope, but your will to survive knew no bounds. So, after years of struggle, you made it through. But then,
        what do you do when nothing waits on the other side, and you’ve exhausted yourself?
    </p>

    <p>A study from 1957 by Curt Richter goes the following: Rats were put in water, and they usually died after a few
        minutes. Wild rats, who are excellent swimmers, and fighters, gave up even sooner. Then, the same test was
        conducted with one difference. Shortly before the rats drowned in their water bucket, they were taken out of the
        water and given time to rest. Then, they were put in the water once more. How long did the rats last for a
        second time after learning that there’s light at the end of the tunnel? Sixty hours.
    </p>

    <p>Imagine being a pilot and crashing in the middle of the freezing ocean. Now you’ve got only a few minutes before
        freezing to death. But don’t you think you would survive a bit longer if you knew with absolute certainty that
        you’d be saved?
    </p>

    <p>If you lose the will to live, it’s over.
    </p>

    <p>Thus, to endure hardship, you need hope. You need to see the light on the other side and know exactly what you
        want and why you want it. Perseverance, resilience, and discipline are only possible with a clear vision.
    </p>

    <p>How do you gain vision? With meditation in solitude.
    </p>

    <p>I’m willing to give up everything to make my dreams come true.
    </p>

    <h1>3. Life is hard outside your room</h1>

    <p>After you’ve found your why and learned the absolute necessity of hope. We need to set a few things straight.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3.1. Modern life is too easy and void </strong></p>

    <p>There’s a sculpture by Michelangelo depicting Mary with her dead son Jesus. It captures what mothers are trying
        to avoid by all means - seeing their children dead. A mother could try to save their children from the world's
        dangers, but unfortunately, that’s impossible. The world may kill one’s body, but staying at home is worse; it
        kills one’s soul.
    </p>

    <p>Life is brutal once you leave your room.
    </p>

    <p>Most men try to live in safety and comfort. The comfort level experienced today is greater than that of past
        kings. You can go to a supermarket and find more variety of food than any king had at his disposal. Palaces
        often had neither toilets nor heating. Those who have everything can’t generate enough will to leave their bed.
        Most have forgotten they used to have dreams. Complacency is the killer of motivation.
    </p>

    <p>Comfort leaves one empty. This void needs to be filled. Why not fill it with entertainment, cynicism, nights out,
        and anxiety?
    </p>

    <p>What’s real, anyway? The majority of books don’t teach anything. Our job rarely has a real purpose. Most of our
        friends don’t even like us. Escaping this comfort is no easy task, but it is necessary nonetheless.
    </p>

    <p>Consider the story of Adam and Eve. In the Garden of Eden, they lived in never-ending comfort. However, a
        comfortable life is meaningless, so they destroyed paradise. – and opened their eyes. Similarly, the Buddha,
        raised in immense luxury and comfort, rejects it after seeing the suffering outside his palace. He realized that
        the desire for pleasure is insatiable and a mere illusion. So, he leaves his paradise.
    </p>

    <p>You must go out there and face the world.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3.2. No one cares about the weak</strong></p>

    <p>A few months ago, I was on a two-week trip near <a href="blog_25.html">Barcelona</a>. My mother wanted me to
        spend time with the son of a
        woman she befriended. So, I got to know this 19-year-old, and I felt shame. He swam slower than my 8-year-old
        brother. He tried to talk about movies and video games with me. His posture was that of a question mark. He was
        such a nice and submissive guy that I may have accidentally insulted him in every sentence.
    </p>

    <p>Then, one day, I told him to stop being weak, and after asking his mother, he agreed to go on a run with me. I
        wanted to run four kilometers, which takes around twenty minutes. After running for no more than twenty seconds
        at a speed I almost considered walking, he quit.
    </p>

    <p>I asked him how many girls had a crush on him.
    </p>

    <p>No one cares about the weak.
    </p>

    <p>I don’t care about compassion; if I feel sorry for him, nothing in his life changes, and hot blondes will not
        start having a crush on him. You may not like it, but this is reality.
    </p>

    <p>He needs momentum to improve. I’ve been in his shoes myself. There used to be a time when I couldn’t do more than
        five pushups. But I felt enough pain to uproot everything and change.
    </p>

    <p>He could undoubtedly blame his mother for raising him weak-minded. But who cares? Even if his critique were
        perfectly accurate, he would still be weak. Laziness, pleasure-seeking, and weakness are intrinsically
        repelling. People are attracted to power.
    </p>

    <p>This is your call to become powerful.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3.3. What my father didn’t teach me</strong></p>

    <p><strong><em>Forget about being special.</em></strong> It takes years of dedication to become special, and even
        then, being special doesn’t mean you can skip the hard work. There is simply no excuse not to do the tedious,
        arduous work.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Are you competing against your past self?</em></strong> Comparison is the thief of joy, they say. So,
        are you competing against your past self or everyone else? Truthfully, no one said they contradict each other.
        I’m competing against myself as well as everyone else. Life is pure competition. Everything you want, others
        want.</p>

    <p><strong><em>No one cares about your excuses.</em></strong> “You were probably a bit tired.” “Your teammates
        messed up, not you.” “It was hot today.” – Except that no one cares about your tiredness. What matters is
        whether you’ve achieved something or not. Your reasons for failing don’t matter; no one will listen. You either
        win or lose – the choice is yours. Life is war. </p>

    <p><strong><em>It’s okay to fail.</em></strong> Most people dramatize failures. Recently, I saw the video of my very
        first judo fight. I fought hard and lost regardless. That happens. Then, the second my fight was over, my mother
        dragged me from the arena, and the instructor yelled at her to leave. What kind of nonsense is that? Am I not
        allowed to lose? </p>

    <p><strong><em>Mastery takes a lot more work than you think.</em></strong> Every 11th grader had to write a 10-page
        paper on a random topic. Some were proud of theirs; they thought they’d done something worth mentioning. Guess
        what? After I’ve written 150,000+ words, I’m still not a master. There’s no way around putting in the work. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The twenty-hour rule.</em></strong> While mastery requires immense effort, there are shortcuts to
        becoming proficient. There’s the 20-hour rule. It takes just two focused days to become good at something, which
        means 80% of a master’s level. For example, learning how to drive takes only twenty hours. Still, you’ll have to
        put in the work. Most never dare to put in the first hour.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Humility.</em></strong> My little brother goes ice skating every week. However, he uses a metal
        scaffold to prevent a slip. His fear of making a mistake makes him unable to progress. I learned to ice skate in
        two hours because I wasn’t scared to slip. Courses where children learn to swim are the biggest nonsense. How do
        you think I learned to swim? Ultimately, humility and making mistakes are crucial for growth. In life, there
        isn’t an easy way to learn. Stop hoping for one. </p>

    <p>Get used to the taste of life, pain.<br>
        There’s never a way around doing the hard work.
    </p>

    <h1>4. Concrete sources of motivation</h1>

    <p>We have now discussed where to find one’s why and how purpose gives strength. We have also discussed how life is
        hard once you leave your room. Now, let’s go a bit further.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.1. Your parents will get older sooner than you think </strong></p>

    <p>Whether you make your parents proud or ashamed of you, you decide. Life will pass faster than you know it, and
        whether you make the most of it, the choice is yours.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.2. Pain, Pressure, Peers</strong></p>

    <p>When you have to do something, it will get done. Deadlines accelerate. When a deadline comes around, suddenly,
        everything flows. A deadline lets you <a href="blog_3.html">focus</a> and filter everything unessential. They
        add certainty,
        accountability, and things to leverage your subconscious – they align every thought to your goal.
    </p>

    <p>Competition is another form of pressure. Where does a dandelion grow taller, on a meadow or on the side of a
        road, where it’s alone? They grow taller in a meadow.
    </p>

    <p>Pain is also a fantastic motivator. When there’s no other choice, magic can happen.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.3. When there’s no other option</strong></p>

    <p>I need to become a millionaire. I don’t want to get rich; I need to. My parents have a precise vision for my
        life. They want me to study some random nonsense in university, they want me to get an ugly girl boss wife, and
        they want me to work in a job that doesn’t add any real value to the world. Daddy wants me to be a nerd. The
        problem is, I’m not really into ugly women, being a nerd, and having an unfulfilling job. I don’t want that kind
        of life. So, I have no other choice. Do you truly understand what ‘I need’ means? It means I can’t live any
        other way. I wouldn’t ever kill myself, but I couldn’t live any other way. If I lost everything, I would have
        nothing to lose. If there’s nothing to lose, one can only gain. This is my only choice. I never want to suffer
        the pain of a dull and unfulfilling life. </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.4. Momentum</strong></p>

    <p>How have I stayed on self-improvement for three years? Because my life kept getting better.
    </p>

    <p>How did I have enough will for this to be my 96th publication? Because every text can change someone’s life.
    </p>

    <p>How did I keep working nine hundred days in a row? How did I keep working, even if it meant working on the beach?
        How could I put thousands of hours into my now-failed apps? Because I felt the difference.
    </p>

    <p>I love to give my best. I want to exhaust myself. I’m full of life.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.5. Energy transmutation</strong></p>

    <p>Anger is direction. I can feel fury to the point where I can work all day long. I’m angry that my parents want me
        to get an ugly girlfriend. I needed genuine fury to overcome my phone addiction and to fix my life. Anger, hate,
        and disgust are perfect motivators.
    </p>

    <p>When I’m in despair, insecure, or bitter, I train even harder. When I feel depressed, I get braver. When I feel
        shame, I reassess my life choices. When I feel jealous, I work harder. When I'm hopeless, I do pushups. When I'm
        frustrated, I push even harder.
    </p>

    <p>Traumas accelerate. I’ve been homeless, emotionally abused, lonely, bullied, and sick; I saw a close relative
        die; I grew up without a father, and I'm still alive! Now I have a story and have seen things most never will.
    </p>

    <p>Revenge is also a fantastic motivator. To all the girls who could have been mine, give me a few years!
    </p>

    <p>I use every emotion as fuel. – That’s energy transmutation.
    </p>

    <p>You are constantly transmuting energy, whether you realize it or not. For example, video games transmute the
        desire to explore, social media redirects your sexual desire, and sweets transmute the desire for healthy
        nutrition. The problem is that most transmutations work against you. That means that to use energy
        transmutation, you have to analyze your current energy flow. How do you analyze your energy flow? Through
        meditation in solitude.
    </p>

    <p>Your strongest energy is sexual desire – the desire to create. By gaining control over it, you unlock mastery
        over every other energy; that’s how a genius is created. How do you master your sexual energy? By breathing
        upright and breathing deeply.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.6. Your hot blonde</strong></p>

    <p>Without women, I wouldn’t be interested in the world. For that matter, I believe that no man would want to
        conquer, explore space, and do the impossible if it were not for women. Doing something to gain a woman’s
        respect is pure motivation. </p>

    <h1>5. Sources of motivation beyond</h1>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.1. The duty of being</strong></p>

    <p>What’s the meaning of life? Is it to serve others, be virtuous when no one is watching, live by God’s will, find
        your way, or love unconditionally? – I think all of these approaches have a common point: Life is a test. </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.2. Completion</strong></p>

    <p>What is perfectionism? Is it merely a mask for procrastination? Perhaps. But I also believe perfection is a
        silent whisper, “This is good, but it could be better.” Between the relentless pursuit of excellence, amidst the
        tension between good and great, true beauty is born.
    </p>

    <p>Completion matters. One can find contentment in the present yet still pause, breathe deeply, and ponder, “Yes, I
        am happy. But could I not be more?” - That’s the essence of self-improvement, an intrinsic desire to transcend
        our current selves, to evolve continually.
    </p>

    <p>Nature itself is an eternal quest for completion. A tree relentlessly stretches toward its ideal form. A stream
        flows tirelessly until it finds the sea. Mountains ascend until time, and elements shape them anew. In this
        ceaseless striving, we see the essence of true perfection.
    </p>

    <p>Perfection is not a place to reach on a distant horizon. Instead, it’s a teacher. It is a call to embrace the
        process, find joy in striving, and see beauty unfolding. As we journey through life, each chapter brings a new
        landscape to traverse. My favorite emotion is how the golden leaves dance in the last sunshine of the year.
        Nothing is better than working on something for years, exhausting yourself, and then experiencing a few breaths
        of serene stillness. This is what fulfillment feels like—it is both fleeting and permanent. Each brush stroke
        may bring horror, but the resulting image is breathtaking.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.3. Legacy</strong></p>

    <p>A teacher surpassed by his students becomes immortal. That’s legacy. - What do you want to leave behind? What do
        you want your life to be about? Do you want your name etched into eternity? Do you want to create more life?</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.4. Transcendence</strong></p>

    <p>In the quiet chambers of the soul lies transcendence. To transcend is to rise above the mundane, see beyond the
        immediate, and embrace the cosmic dance. The universe is harmoniously aligned with the eternal ballet of
        creation and dissolution. Life was never about you; it’s bigger than that—a terrifying and liberating insight.
        Life starts the moment you realize your cosmic insignificance.
    </p>

    <p>Genuine purpose is transcendent—it’s beyond your ambition and <a href="blog_33.html">desire</a>. It echoes the
        primordial call of the universe, urging us to fulfill our unique roles in the grand symphony of existence.
        Viewing the bigger picture gives meaning to every moment. We find peace in knowing that our existence, though
        brief, contributes to the endless flow of time and space.
    </p>

    <p>Being alive is the strangest experience one can have. Why is there a voice in one's head? What did one think
        thirty seconds ago? The sublime lies in these questions at the edge of our existence. It's not particularly
        challenging to live in excessive comfort. Expanding the edge is the hardest thing one can do. So, is it worth
        doing? - The sublime is precisely the edge of one's existence. It does not only break convention; it is the
        embodiment thereof.
    </p>

    <p>Why not make the most of an eye’s blink called life?
    </p>

    <p>Ultimately, transcendence is about unity. It is the realization that we are all interconnected, bound by the same
        cosmic threads. Our struggles, joys, and aspirations are all part of a larger narrative, a story that has
        unfolded since the dawn of time.
    </p>

    <p>Do you see how love is the greatest source of motivation?
    </p>
