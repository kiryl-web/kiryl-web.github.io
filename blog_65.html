But atheism will bring you nowhere, as there has to be something filling your mind and I hope you choose religion over materialism. It also doesn't mean that you need to go to church every day, religion happens in your mind!">

    <h1>Atheism doesn't exist</h1>

    <p>Today, I went on a half-day hike, first out of town, then through the countryside, and finally through the
        forested mountains. I aimed to find a specific ruin to photograph, which I did. I did not encounter a single
        soul.</p>

    <p>The sun was already creating a golden atmosphere. It was warm, there were no clouds, and it was quiet. On my way
        home, I tried to do something. I tried to interrupt the silence and tried to shout. - I couldn't. Even though I
        was alone, I didn’t feel alone.</p>

    <p>Your mind isn't built to be an atheist, believing in nothing. You know and live with the knowledge, assumption,
        or <em>belief</em> that someone else is always watching, regardless of your will. Atheism is not real.</p>

    <p>I wasn't religious my whole life, either. I was raised to be an orthodox Christian, but I didn't care about it
        very much. Around the age of 13, I didn't pray; I tried to live ‘on my own.’ I, too, thought that faith wasn’t
        necessary. I couldn’t help but notice the hole in my heart. When I looked in the mirror, I figured something was
        missing. It was God.</p>

    <p>I can't <em>believe</em> I used to live with prayers and meditation. Pretending you don't need God isn't enough.
        Malicious ideology won’t replace true faith. Fortunately, I turned back to God. Now, my soul is at peace.</p>

    <p>Religion prevents moral degradation. Everyone falls for temptations except those who are true to their faith.
        Temptations always exist, and they are traps. It takes the knowledge of right and wrong to live by the deepest
        realization. There are endless stories of people who return to faith.</p>

    <p>Those who are not faithful live in ignorance. The devil clearly exists. There has to be an equal and opposite
        force to restore harmony in the universe. Most are aligned with the devil unless they turn to God. </p>

    <p>I believe that the quality of one’s soul and the depth of one’s <a href="blog_70.html">consciousness</a>
        determine whether one can be saved. That’s why most will continue to live without feeling a hole in their heart.
    </p>

    <p>From my life experience, I must tell you something. The number of coincidences doesn’t add up to statistical
        probability. Smaller and greater miracles happen more often than they should. Insurmountable odds get defeated
        too often. How can that be? With enough life experience, you will see. There are forces beyond your
        comprehension. You may call them God.</p>
