    <h1>Should I lie a bit?</h1>

    <p><em><strong>Reality is complicated.</strong></em> There is one thing every single person can agree on, except if
        they are a person that never thought a thought or entertained thinking that satire is propelling humanity
        forward, frankly, those are not less detached than a person who does not think, what should one think perverted
        thoughts for? The universal and absolute idea everyone can agree on is that reality is too complex to ever be
        understood or described to its full extent. Any attempt at doing so may achieve the opposite, just as the
        establishment of paradise on earth always shepherds to annihilation. Now, if reality is too complex ever to be
        grasped, let alone be experienced, logically there must be points at which every model thereof breaks. Another
        thing that everyone can agree on is that telling the truth is generally morally justifiable. And there you have
        a conflict every person has to face with everything they say - when to lie?</p>

    <p><em><strong>Colliding world views.</strong></em> So, there are two models depicting reality with great accuracy.
        For one the model of mesotesis by Aristotle, which, to use a soft expression, recommends one to live in shortage
        nor excess, virtue lies in the middle. There is the second model equally dominant if not even predominant. It's
        the categorial imperative “act only on that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a
        universal law” or the less precise golden rule anchored in (Mattew 7:12) “Therefore all things whatsoever ye
        would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” Their contradiction approaches inevitability because
        their logical conclusions want us to weigh whether we should lie in a given situation and the second principle
        wants us to prioritize the truth in any scenario, or at least cut out the possibility of a lie. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Golden middle.</strong></em> There is truth and there is a rejection thereof, what does the middle
        mean in this case? - silence or lying when it's clearly useful? The golden middle would set a preference for the
        truth, one could argue that lying is a sword, with which you can both slice and kill. One could also argue that
        lies are necessary to gain some social acceptance and also to save social harmony. It's easy to comfort someone
        with a lie, and often it's precisely this comfort someone needs. People also enjoy seduction willingly. The
        truth is always unchanging, but the comforting lie is an emotional defense, and because we aren't purely
        rational beings desiring the truth it does make sense to lie. Another argument for lying is the old question of
        the axe murder, where you know the location of the person who's about to be butchered and have the option to lie
        to the murderer about the victim's location. In this case, every person would categorically lie, no matter how
        important the truth is and the fact that it's going to come out in any case. Now the next argument for lying
        sometimes stems from my parents, they argue that if I were to never lie to my children because I care about the
        truth so much, they would grow up to become damaged individuals with broken self-esteem and I would also lose my
        wife in the process. Do you see, the model of the golden middle transcends every example: lying to your children
        in excess ruins them just as much as a lack of manipulation, as they are not truth machines. Lies can save lives
        and lies bring comfort which sometimes is necessary. When everything is lied nothing exists, and when nothing is
        lied nothing makes sense. So, a person of virtue is wise and knows when to do what.</p>

    <p>Now I've argued for lying and still I never do - I command - don't lie! </p>

    <p><em><strong>Categoric morality.</strong></em> Look at history and try to look for any good created by lies… If
        you don't like your parents-in-law, why pretend you do, who are you doing a favor, do you envision spending more
        time with them, if you like them so much? If you are late on something, don't point to a lack of time, you've
        had plenty and just wasted all, that happens to everyone, what does lying bring in this case scenario? What do
        you need fake compliments for, if you can use real ones instead? You may be tempted to think that the truth lies
        in the middle, between lying a bit and categorially refusing to lie and that's where two contradictory models of
        reality would meet and solve conflicts, and I would say no, for every lie there is a truth you can use as an
        alternative. - If you can't think of any, perhaps reassess your life or the other person. Lying is weakness, you
        must be strong! Lying will not only make you lose respect for others but will lead to something a lot less
        desirable; you lose respect in front of yourself! You are the person who suffers the most from your lies, so why
        do you keep hating yourself, why are you your worst enemy, why are you trying to push yourself down? I can also
        reveal another argument for never lying, which is that it assumes the other person has no dignity, like a dumb
        incapacitated little somewhat. I can tell you I've hated being 'lied' to as a child. I know that my example is
        not representative, but I found it annoying that my peers believed in false realities such as 'Father Christmas'
        and I seemed to be the only conscious child, and this self-perception continued and it serves me well until this
        day. Can you desire to live as such a person who thinks others are undeserving of the truth? Why do you assume
        that the other person does not deserve the truth? You can't. We must put it as an axiom “Only reality is good,”
        everything else leads to a meaningless disaster. You cannot build something on lies hoping that it's going to
        work out, because the truth is constant and omnipresent, it takes merely a crack to make one see it. Card house.
        The more layers of lies you stack, the easier it's going to be to go around them to discover what is real. I
        dictate, hoping that you will listen, the best dating advice is to be yourself while not being a loser. You
        can't pretend to be someone else unless you have taken steps to improve that negative trait for a while and it
        started to fade into insignificance, that's when fake-it-till-you-make-it shall be permitted. If we think about
        honesty, one must not forget what it's for in the first place; if a person is honest at all times, he won't do
        something bad in the first place. When you are honest about problems, they can be fixed, because you remove the
        protective layers and can straight-up pick the problem up and remove it. You can't afford to live a life where
        you have some dark secrets, hoping that they will never reveal themselves, otherwise, you will not only have
        made a mistake but also failed to take responsibility and made the problem even worse. Who will suffer the most
        from your lies? - You. Why do you torture yourself with it? Most people are forgiving, since everyone makes
        mistakes and that's an extremely liberating thought. Telling the truth is also valuable in itself, life is
        complicated and may not go your way, hence the only remaining thing is morality. You must desire to act right no
        matter what, I don't want to decide for you what right means here. Especially because you are expected to lie in
        certain situations, you can set yourself apart if you don't. Do you want to be lied to, even if those are
        comforting words intended to bring virtue? Well, here is a thing every great person who has ever lived can agree
        on: it's better to live in true hell than a lie in heaven. Also, a lot of people don't understand and I can tell
        from my experience: you will never enter a situation where you will be forced to lie!</p>

    <p>In ancient Chinese philosophy of the Tao, there is something in the universe that makes water flow downhill
        and creates a harmony between valley and mountain. This said Tao can be translated as path, but now I'm
        entitled enough to translate it as 'truth,' the Tao is everywhere and unchanging and often hard to see,
        hidden in a layer of mystery. Yet, it transcends the universe's entirety, and one is often blind to this
        Path. Hence, lying can be interpreted as going against the universe's divine order. <em><br>“Ever desireless,
            one
            can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but
            differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery” - Lao Tzu</em>
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Hence, I command - don't lie, obfuscate, manipulate, or euphemize! Tell the truth, or shut
                up!</strong></em></p>

    <p><em>But then, what tell the truth for? Is it truly better to try to live with the truth than in a fool's
            paradise? How can we know what the truth even is? The choice is yours. - Or maybe free will is the
            biggest lie of all. So, that means the only thing left is love, not the truth.</em> </p>
