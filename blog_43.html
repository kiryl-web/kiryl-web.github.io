    <h1>Above and beyond</h1>

    <p><em>How would you compress an entire life into a single story?<br>I found a way to summarize my timeless
            principles.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

    <p><em><strong>My short story.</strong></em> Since I was 13, I have desired to become a businessman.
        That was two and a half years ago. I worked relentlessly on this goal. I started to learn how to code at the end
        of 2020 and created my first videos in mid-2021. In August 2022, I finally released my first app, a mental math
        app. In March 2023, I reinvented my videos and focused on documenting my journey. In the meantime, monumental
        lifestyle and health improvements magnified my capabilities. I had perfected every aspect of my life, from diet
        to sleep to time management. I had zero <a href="blog_77.html">bad habits</a> and distractions. It was the first
        perfect month. I gave my
        best every day.</p>

    <p><em><strong>My apps.</strong></em> Even though I published the first version in August 2022, I considered the app
        ‘done’ in April 2023, one year after initial development. Now it’s August 2023; almost one year ago, the first
        version came online. Since my app was done, I started to think more tactically. I looked at all the other apps I
        competed with and noticed none were truly remarkable. They didn't care about design, motivation, fun, or user
        feedback. I identified an opportunity and strategically planned my next move.</p>

    <p><strong>The preparation</strong></p>

    <p><em>How do I demonstrate ruthless commitment and dedication, going above and beyond?</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>Position is as valuable as content.</strong></em> I understood that. If no one ever sees my products,
        they’re useless. So, I thought, how do I potentially gain attention for my apps and establish my solidity? I
        looked at the chess board and conceived the best move.</p>

    <p>I would complete 10,000 mental math tasks to prove that my mental math apps are easy to use, encouraging,
        motivating, engaging, and excellent for their goal. This challenge would also demonstrate that I am committed,
        dedicated, capable, serious, creative, and uncompromising. I am not scared of challenges and go above and beyond
        for my users, viewers, and customers. <br>Who even is my competition? Who made the other apps? Some random geek?
        – I’m
        coming to take what’s his!</p>

    <p><em><strong>I thought strategically.</strong></em> Has that ever been done before? No. I would even be the first.
        Perfect. Now, solving ten thousand mental math tasks sounds like a big task. I wrote three pages of meditation.
        I have used my perspicacity to think ahead. Ten thousand. One task takes four seconds. Forty thousand seconds.
        Six hundred sixty-six minutes. Wait, that’s only eleven hours! Instead of getting overwhelmed by ten thousand
        math tasks, I looked at the data and made a calculated decision. I knew that it had to be ten thousand because
        winner takes all; going a bit further amplifies results. </p>

    <p><em><strong>In April 2023,</strong></em> I knew I didn't possess the mental capacity to pull off the challenge.
        But I also knew that everything comes at the right time. I waited and grew mentally. Then, the summer was at its
        apex, in June, and I couldn’t do anything because I burned out after nine hundred days of intense work. I waited
        a few more weeks, and then I was ready. This patience and self-awareness were crucial to my success. </p>

    <p>Now is the 5th week of the summer holidays, it’s August 2023.</p>

    <p><strong>The execution </strong></p>

    <p>On August 9th, 2023, I prepared mentally for the last time. I felt fear but knew that I had no option but to
        succeed. I had so much faith that failure wasn’t an option. I had to pull it off. This unwavering commitment and
        dedication were at the core of my focus. </p>

    <p>On August 10th, 2023, I got up at half past six. I installed a second instance of the app on my phone because I
        didn’t want to clutter the app's daily progress menu, which shows ten thousand tasks a day, magnitudes higher
        than my daily goal. </p>

    <p>Then, at 8:20, I got started.</p>

    <p>The first hundred math tasks were by far the hardest, and after the first five hundred, I already had to take a
        break, which took half an hour. The outlook was terrible; five hundred in thirty minutes had already exhausted
        me. But I had to keep going.</p>

    <p>I rested again as I completed the next five hundred, a thousand in total.</p>

    <p>The next thousand were already a lot easier, so I only took breaks once for every thousand tasks. I had to change
        the battery in my camera multiple times. I recorded my phone with my other phone and everything else, including
        the computer displaying the time, with my real camera. </p>

    <p>I <em>calculated</em> that recording everything would take up to 170 GB, so I recorded only in timelapse mode,
        which is
        why it only took 10 GB. </p>

    <p>After I completed four thousand tasks, I ate lunch. After that, I got into a deep state of flow, where I did not
        think about anything, and my fingers magically typed or selected the correct answer. </p>

    <p>The last six thousand tasks felt less exhausting than the first two thousand. However, it was getting hotter as
        the day progressed, and my brain was more exhausted by the minute. As the discomfort increased, my <a
            href="blog_3.html">focus</a> became
        sharper. I certainly did not expect this to happen. </p>

    <p>The flow was so deep that I could complete the last two rounds of tasks and two hours of math without a break.
        Towards the end, my hands began to shake out of exhaustion. </p>

    <p>After eleven hours and ten minutes, I was done. </p>

    <p>I felt nothing, had no thoughts, and felt like I was asleep. Why did I wait four months, from April to August?
        Everything comes at the right time. I used this time to attain mastery over my mind. I can confirm that my
        spirit is indomitable. I could turn off the voices in my head, as they were of no use. I saw only me and my
        goal, which I had now reached, a testament to my personal growth and mastery. </p>

    <p>Ten thousand mental math tasks in 11 hours and 10 minutes. Things take as long as you want them to take. I can’t
        stress the importance of <a href="blog_62.html">speed</a>.</p>

    <p>Solving ten thousand mental math tasks is an excellent exercise for the spirit.</p>

    <p>Even if everything fails, including the videos and the apps, the memory stays. I now know what I’m capable of.
        Now, I can’t take doubters seriously. I have full conviction of myself.<br> May my story start now.</p>

    <p>Through relentless dedication and strategic foresight, I've transformed a daunting challenge into a testament to
        my unwavering commitment. This journey has proven my capabilities and solidified my belief that true mastery is
        achieved by those who dare to go above and beyond.</p>

    <p>I will finish with a quote.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Uncompromising excellence <br> 
                is a true testament to the indomitability <br>
                of my spirit.
