    <h1>On my first day at university</h1>

    <p>I entered the lecture room and sat next to the girl I found prettiest – just as I had envisioned months prior.
        She revealed that she also studied biomedical engineering and was in my group. It was the second week of
        October, and for the first time, I met my entire biomedical engineering major. By then, the lessons hadn’t
        started, and every event was about getting to know the university.
    </p>

    <p>As the day went on, I found out that many knew me. This was no accident. A few weeks prior, I had organized a
        meetup to gain recognition. The meetup itself was disappointing because everyone present was timid and
        introverted. Next to gaining recognition, I had to compensate because I would frequently make a fool of myself
        by not knowing the schedule. Regarding compensation, I also drove an hour to the faculty building to take a
        photo for the group chat because I once laughed at the wrong moment. I spent the first days with a guy who knew
        me from last year’s business competition and his friends. The first few days were very awkward, perhaps because
        everything was new. I didn’t make any friends, but to be fair, by then, it had only been two days – and I'm
        playing the big game.
    </p>

    <p>Then, it was already Friday evening of the second October week, and school would start on Monday. On that
        evening, I was driving to Leipzig to attend a business event. After traveling for four hours, I arrived and
        enjoyed it very much. I told the event’s organizer, who I had known for two years, that I might leave soon
        because I may go on a date with a girl I met online. I was surprised when he asked me if she was blonde – he
        told me he had read my entire blog, which made me feel deeply appreciated. That date never occurred because she
        responded that she ‘had no time’ – but I'm not stupid. As the evening progressed, I, of course, started to talk
        about dating. After a one-hour “reality check,” it turned out I was actually unattractive. The girls who were
        clearly interested in me didn’t matter and I was told I should try self-improvement. I guess I was living in an
        illusion, you see?
    </p>

    <p>For those of you new to my blog, I’ve dedicated the last four years to self-improvement, and I couldn’t believe
        what nonsense I heard. Anyway. I returned home at two in the morning.
    </p>

    <p>When I got up, I spent two hours completing the math homework, and I felt like an absolute idiot because I got
        almost nothing done. Even though I spent all day long, I worked only for two hours.
    </p>

    <p>The next day, I was presented with a unique opportunity. I could continue to do the homework or go on a little
        adventure—it was the last day before the lectures started. Having lived at a homeless shelter at nine, having
        two failed businesses behind me, and having finished 12th grade at 16 with a perfect high school diploma, I took
        the latter option.
    </p>

    <p>I put on my boots and grabbed my camera. The sun would be setting in precisely four hours. I wanted to photograph
        waterfalls while following woodland trails – something I had not done in a year. I found a few smaller
        waterfalls and returned to the ferry connecting the train.
    </p>

    <p>“Excuse me, are you a photographer … ?”
    </p>

    <p>A sweet young lady with a heavy accent seemed interested in my photos. So, I gave her my business card, and
        that’s when we started to speak in Russian. We would spend the next five hours together, walking through the city.
    </p>

    <p>The sky is starry when you’re young; indeed, it is. She awaited her departure, so I knew we would never meet
        again.
    </p>

    <p>I slept very little because university started early. After the introductory week, it was now time for the real
        lectures. My first lecture was about anatomy, and I liked it. A few more lessons followed, and the rest of the
        day was unremarkable. I was active during the lessons because I believed in doing more than the bare minimum.
        Even though I may not care about university, I want to excel. It feels like now I have a purpose. Thus, I'm back
        with direction.
